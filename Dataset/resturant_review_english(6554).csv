I was served cold food, even the mushroom soup was barely warm. And something is wrong with your mashed potato, it is usually so yummy (in Gulshan branch) but in my last two visits in dhanmondi branch I was disappointed with it too (may be the chef here is not getting the recipe right) Anyway, I really hope you guys were just having a bad day, but please make sure this doesn't happen again...COLD food is just not acceptable. I look forward to visit you many more times, please don't ruin the place for me. Thank you",1

"This is a great fast food place. I mean it. The food was great. Not too expensive. They have a very classy Burger on menu Like Mr.Pounder & Mr.Alexander.

The quality of their food is excellent specially the mega platter, dumplings, hot wings and kulfi are mouth-watering delicious. Along with the food Hakka Dhaka Baily Road also has a very warm, friendly and inviting environment with excellent customer service. Specially I always appreciate Saim's service, who recently got promoted to branch manager. He has always pleased us a lot. Congratulations to him for his success, the staff working under him are also pretty good, Saim is managing his branch pretty well. Today Nahid's service also pleased us. It's an amazing restaurant with great food, me and my family love this place. Wishing them all the best.",1

I love the taste of every item here â™¥â™¥â™¥ Especially cookies and cream shake â™¥,1
"I always loved the food of Hakka Dhaka as I was visiting you from the very beginning I guess. But today for ones I thought of rating you 4 instead of 1. Reason: I always liked your food because it was a different chinese. Hot & spicy. But today, (I visited you almost after an year) i didnâ€™t get that spicy chinese.(specially the Mongolian beef). We can have Chinese in many other restaurants. But the taste you provided was incomparable to us. However, the food was good and the service was too good as always.",1

Otherwise they are the best,so 1*.ï¿½",1
"The Hakka Chinese is mouth watering! Each dish made us feel droll. The smokey flavors of fried rice and noodles was very much appealing. Ambience was good, but the problem of mosquitoes is a little acute though delicious foods over - scored it! We noticed a good food serving and welcoming behaviour in Hakka Dhaka, but a bit more personal hygienic attitude was expected from the waiters. Overall, it's a geeat restaurant for foodies, a must visit place!",1

The true flavor of Hakka Chinese. Good with quantity and a taste.,1
"Amazing place & great hakka Chinese. Most importantly I liked the platter of joy, which was introduced recently. Its a great deal for 2/4. One thing definitely can be improved, is the sound management of the restaurant, as when it becomes too much crowdy, noise of talking starts to reflect & gets irritated. Service of the waiters can also be made more classy. Above all Food was delicious, so I would love to visit again & again.",1

Had dinner at Hakka Dhaka last night and simply loved it! The owner himself came over at the table to explain the menu & to suggest what we should order! Now that you don't see everyday! The food was seriously Hakka and seriously good! The Buffalo Wings & Honey-Glazed Chicken were actually good enough to write home or statuses about. I'm definitely going back; and this time with more people!,1
Amazing food! Absolutely love it!,1
Jossssssss.....awwwwwwsummmmm.......Jhakkkkkkaaaaaas. what a combination of food. Like the price which is affordable.........,1

Amazing food!!!!Simply loveeee Hakka Dhaka!!,1
"Chinese as it should be! The exterior of the shop reminded me of Chinatown in Leicester sq. and the food had the authenticity that most shops fail to deliver. The wings, crispy beef and prawns in particular, insanely good. And to go with it the pricing is reasonable. If the owners manage to keep the quality consistent and continue to give personal attention to customers, then Hakka Dhaka is definitely going places.",1
Loved the food and the place!!!,1
"Great food, cozy setup, good pricing & location. First time to get a reservation confirmed over facebook message. Awaiting full launch and new menu for soups etc. They're a hit even with soft launch and two set menu! Had Platter A with parents, wife & kids, gotta visit again for Platter B. Brought back home leftovers for visiting relatives and they loved it too. Compliments to the Chef who seemed busy training staff!",1
Best wishes for Shohel & Shajib...hope you will do the best.,1

Suggesting the authority to keep some options of online payment system like Dmoney, Ipay, Upaye etc for hassle-free and secured online payment of bill. ... We the employees of Dmoney and Square Group wish to pay the bill with Dmoney Account instantly. Cash transaction is too much main stream & hazard full to us. Best wishes from Zaman, Dmoney Bangladesh Ltd.",1

Joey and Levi are the best! My favorite place in savannah! Always quick and wonderful service! Great drinks!,1
"I went there yesterday with my friends. We ordered Chicken steak with fried rice and beef steak also. It was awesome in one words. I think, i ate one of the best steak in dhaka City. They served nicely and did not take long time to serve. But negative thing is that they have no sufficient soft drinks so that it was very tough to choice one for drinking. Anyway though food was little bit costly but taste was good so that anybody should consider that cost!!",1
Best Chicken steak <3 This is literally best but please don't increase the price range all of a sudden... :) just keep the signature Chicken steak always as it is.... Best of luck :),1
Best chicken steak ! And impressive service ï¿½,1
Food was good!But I was a bit too spicy.,1

I ordered chicken steak and pineapple juice.both food was good and tasty..,1
"I found it to be consistent. Went there on 21/2/17. It was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and the food quality remained good like before. Their chicken steak is something I crave for every single day. I tried their platter 'Epic Romance' and the chicken steak and the jumbo prawns were definitely highlight of the dish. The wedges were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and the cheesy rice complimented the dish pretty well. I would also suggest their beef bento and their lemon chicken meal. Those are really good too.",1
Very good food and also good service.....ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Love the environment and the food. The service is also excellent.,1
Really happy with their food n services :) Best of luck.,1
Good taste... Good Presentation... The mouthwatering flavour of the steak,1
"Love the place, the aesthetics, the food, and the service. In any aspect, one critical factor is style and originality; Treehouse has an abundance of it Ideal if you want to take someone out for a great meal and a meaningful conversation; the place itself is a great conversation starter Not ideal at all of you wanna skip class and go there for some ""hanky-panky"". You better stick to Argeela for it Be ready to spend about 1k-2k per person",1
Their chicken steak is my favorite & i just wanna say their steak is excellentðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,1

Best chicken steak in town. A bit expensive but worth it. ï¿½,1
"It was great visiting there.there customer service,food,decoration everything deserves 1* .",1
Definitely a bit pricey but the food was worth it. Liked the ambience of the 2nd floor but not the 1st. 1st floor seemed to be very stuffy even on a rainy day. Maybe another AC could fix that? Ordered a beef bento as well as a chicken steak. Loved every bit of the food other than the veggies (this might be a personal preference). Had a great time. Thank you! ^_^,1
Just awesome! Most importantly you will get exactly the same food as u see in the picture.....will definitely come here again,1

"In a city of bricks and concretes, yesterday I chose to be at a place like ""Triangle cafe"" for Iftar. The place is situated just beside 3/a Dhanmondi lake, if you're a nature lover like me then its the perfect place for enjoying the soothing weather and gentle breeze of this monsoon. Triangle had two platers, one with a rice bowl and the other offering chowmein. Being a chowmein lover I ordered plater 2 and I have to agree the food was great in quality and sufficient in quantity for one. The BBQ chicken is a must try and also the kebab roll was juicy and spicy. The chowmein tasted perfectly seasoned. Both the platers are priced 410/- BDT all inclusive. I will recommend everyone who is looking for an escape out of this city sensationalism, Triangle is your place to feel the nature and enjoy a quality time with mouthwatering food.",1
"A small cafe which is only accessible through a lakeside walkway in this city of concrete. Very nice place to chill and hangout with friends remaining close to nature. Try their grilled mushroom (ask to make it spicy), boti kebab and/or wraps. Their khichuri is pretty good as well. Chillers/shakes are must try!! Cheers!!",1
"Very nice place to hangout with friends and family cause it is very close to our nature and far away from concrete life. after having our iftar, fortunately we were witness of a heavy rainfall and that was amazing experience. Their iftar platter was delicious. Their grilled mushroom was so good. I m loving it.",1
"What do people expect from a cafe!!! Taste food, reasonable price, good service and a cool and calm atmosphere. I must say I got each n everything rated to be 1 from this cafe ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I love their Grilled Garlic Mushroom with chicken the most ï¿½ï¿½",1
"Environment is way much good for hangout with friends. Lakeside soothing environment was good to enjoy. I appreciate the way management changed the seating arrangements for us, providing chairs instead of wooden tool (y) For Food- its 4.1/1 (Rice, bar b q chicken and mushrooms was delicious, but vegetables can be even better). So, there is a room for improvement. Ambiance, Environment & service- 1/1 without second thought. So, overall a happy customer :)",1
The environment is good. Their food is very delicious and their service is excellent. Had their Nachos which is very good and I found it best when compared with other Nachos. Platters are excellent as well. Their buffalo wings and Nachos are must try. Reasonable price along with good quality and quantity of foods.,1
Environment is too good for hanging out with friends and loved one. Food quality and quantity is just perfect according to the price. I guess they have the Best Nachos in town according to Price and quantity. Their mushroom items are must try too. Will definitely refer to try them again.,1
For me it was a cool place to hang out with friends...main thing is food was Gud ... according to quantity price is reasonable ... itâ€™s near to my residence so I will go often ...,1

"We had total 10 burgers with the BUY ONE GET ONE FREE offer and all of them were so good. The patty was well marinated , the bun was soft and the whole burger was so juicy we had to order one after another :3 Their behavior is good and friendly as well. Highly recommend it ! :D (Y)",1
food is first class you have you try it to believe it,1
"Itâ€™s burger greatness in the most primitive way, large enough to satisfy any hungry burger boy or girl, impossibly juicy and flavorful as can be. The cheese, Vermont Cheddar, adds the flavor it needs to, but could be more melted, although thatâ€™s a recurring problem with most burgers and the cheese that sits atop them in this city. The fries are delicious as well, golden, crispy and beautifully salty, what more do you want?",1
"The Burger patty is really good. Their french fries, the drinks and even pizzas those i had hands on are a taste for the mouth. Well-mannered waiters are there to serve and assist if anything arises to occasion. And If you are wondering about Halal which you should especially in a place like ours, they have these issues covered.Overall, it's a Good Pass from me.",1
I tried chicken cheese burger.it was good. it has a smokey barbecue flavor.quality & service also good enough.,1
Best Thai soup and wonton!! Totally recommend it ï¿½,1
Food quality is best.. so delicious.. but the stall should be more big and enough specious for accommodation at Dhanmondi branch beside Anwar Khan Medical,1
Food was just awesome... It was so much delicious...Maybe the quantity of food was not enough...The service was also good...,1
It was an outstanding snacks from them. Got everything okay like the menu and they served in time. Taste was Nice and delicious...! (y),1
"Price is good, taste even better. The soup and grilled beef sandwich are my favourites. Haven't tried the rest, but looking forward to it.",1
"Simply Awesome, the most authentic burger in town",1
Maybe I'm the customer of AB from when it was born. Me n my family just Love AB.,1

Me n my husband just love KFC chkn.... <3 <3 Gulshan 1 KFC was like our 2nd home.... :D,1
"Their service improves during this RAMADAN. Chickens are good, they improved their taste. No idea in the ""Zinger"" section. Even the floor manager was at their best. Just asked for a thin and VoilÃ  it'll appear in front of you in a moment. But still the behavior of their cashier should be more realistic, more human like. And also they need to put chairs and tables at a distance. It's like a fish market along with putting some kind of door or barrier for separating the Kids zone. The sound was harrowing. Thanks kfc Bangladesh.",1
I think the best qualityfull foods in Lalbagh Area,1
food is good,1

"From my wandering of tasting a good, decent steak, I found my end to this journey in Bangladesh. They serve you the steak full of juicy, tender and gorgeous look. People from inside are friendly enough to give you the proper description of what you are going to have in your plate. I enjoyed every single bite of it. (y) to them. And surely, I would love to visit them again and again.",1
"Went there last Friday with my friend, got surprised a bit seeing such a small place. Upon arrival they waiter attended us with details of their menu as they prepare steaks in two types of Texas style with some deviations. We selected a Sirloin and Tomahawk, which were 300g and 100g. The truth is we were a bit skeptic about the weight they were mentioning but to our surprise they showed us the raw steaks that they were about to prepare for us. This was a nice touch. Liked the... way they ask customers approval for the cuts before preparing it as they were doing it for all the guests in other tables too. After waiting for around 30 mins, the steaks arrived. We ordered medium done and medium rare the steaks were exactly like we ordered. The medium rare Tomahawk tasted even better than my medium done Sirloin. Both the steaks had sof juicy center with flavorful seared crusts. Loved every bite of the tender steak till the end. The portion is quite hefty along with the sides of mashed potato and sautee vegetables. The sauces were nice compliment to the steak, would recommend their roast bacon glace for sure. This will be my steak place from now on for as long as they serve steaks like that.",1
"One of the best steak I ever had in Dhaka. Done and Texture was perfect. Price is high, so is the size, 300 grams to fill your tum and tastebud. Mashed potato was great.",1
"First glimpse will depict a small cozy diner bustling with energy as I have been there at dinner time. Fortunately we got our seats as we reserved earlier that day through phone. Ordered a Ribeye and Sirloin which were 300g each as per menu and done in true Texas style, which I was a bit skeptic at first. Then to my surprise they bought the raw cut in front of us and asked if we liked the cut and marbling. This is something we never experience in any steakhouse before, no one... asks about marbling of the meat in any steakhouse so far I have visited in Bangladesh. I started loving the place form that moment as the Ribeye had very good marbling in it. Just after that they served us complementary corn soups which were good gesture from their behalf and it was good too. Had to wait nearly 21 mins before we got the food and my friend asked the waiter why it takes this long to serve, then we came to know about the smoking process. They actually smoke each and every steak with imported woodchips and when we asked if they could show us the woodchips they certainly did, mixture of dry Apple & Hickory woodchips! Finally the steaks arrived and wow, perfectly seared medium rare steaks with juicy slight red center and dark crust outside. The first bite actually depicted all about that smoking stuff and for real it felt like I having a real steak, which I have seen for so long in TLC and other TV shows. The perfect thickness, sides of mashed potato and amazing sauces, though I did not like to use sauce in steaks as they are supposed to be juicy for medium rare done and in this case it was. Their service was good too as the waiters were polite and knowledgeable. This is my new favorite place for steaks and would highly recommend if anyone is looking for thick cut juicy steaks in Dhaka.",1
Best steak in town right now and also liked the thing that they will at first show you the raw steak and if you are okay with it then they will grill it for you :D,1
"Took sirloin Steak, mashed potato, mushroom and poutine. All of the items were really mouthwatering. Environment was good. Service was very good. Loved the place.",1
"They really do have some good sirloin steaks in the town. I havent been to all of thr steak houses in Dhaka, so i couldnt yet call them the best.",1
"In recent times, I've tasted many dishes but none has come close to the taste and deliciousness of the steaks of this place. The steak piece is so tender and juicy, meat juice literally comes out when you cut a piece of the steak. The side dishes with the steak are also delicious specially the sauces. The sauses enhanced the flavor of the steak. When i put a piece of steak in my mouth, it felt so good.I dare say, this place is the best place to get steak if you want taste, quality and quantity. i will come here again to taste everything asap. N.B.- The environment and the music of this place is excellent. Also the service was great Good luck to this place",1

"Went to Woodhouse Grill today. Already I had an Experience about the Steak in Bangladesh. So as usual with timid heart and boosted morale entered to the venue. Little small but neat and clean.....the employees are very cordial...soft spoken and well trained. They I have seen describing the customers in detail about the type of cut, dish and side dishes. I have met the owner little latter. He was also very cordial and helpful. To taste for the 1st time....I asked for a Pepper ...Steak and level of cooking I asked is Medium well done. I received the food and cut the piece of meat....the knife was smooth and I put the first piece in my mouth.....mmmmm....delicious.....but the cooking was Well Done. The owner observed my food and he was not satisfied with the cooking level, he returned my steak back and served another steak cooked in perfection as Medium Well Done. The incident depict how sincere and customer oriented they are. I am fully satisfied and wish to go frequently there. If the remain committed regarding their standard and customer satisfaction no doubt they will rise above the horizon....Viva Woodhouse Grill. I definitely recommend to taste the steak in Woodhouse Grill.",1
Awesome option for steak lovers - try out the west texan style steaks...:),1
"The steak is really good and so are the appetisers! They serve great portions of meat too. One small feedback, need to reduce the amount of pepper in the steak ï¿½ All in all, a big thumbs up ï¿½",1
The finest steakhouse in Dhaka. Would highly recommend their West Texan style steaks.,1
"If you want steak, you got your place right here! The steaks were really juicy and it is done the way it is supposed to be done. Totally recommended, both for food and service.",1
"In our visit, they served absolutely tender and juicy steaks, with well cooked grilled vegetables, real steak sauce and a bonus butter sauce! Everything was cooked to perfection. After you place the order they show you the pieces of meats/cuts - which is a great thing for the real steak lovers. The owner himself gave us briefs about all the steaks, making yourself clear about the one you are ordering. In summary, a perfect steakhouse with original recipe - highly recommended for real steak lovers!",1

Thanks to #foodbuzz for making a special day â€˜Super Specialâ€™! Today I want to express my gratitude to foodbuzz who unconditionally helped me create a special memory! I wanted to give a surprise to my special one on our Aniversiry.The initial plan was to gather at foobuzz with all our friends and spend a nice time together. But I wasnâ€™t sure if the people from there would cooperate without any booking or any charge. So I called at the number from their Facebook page and I was surprised instead at the enthusiasm and willingness they showed.There isnâ€™t much I can do to repay them but I at least wanted to thank them here and inform people about their hospitality,1
Tried the Larb Gai salad. Happy me :) Awesome place for partying.,1
"Place : #foodbuzz ok so before I start rating their food and service and what not let me start off by saying what they did right that other restaurants usually don't. 1st - The food actually looks as they were advertised. 2nd - They actually served the food hot, yes you heard it right ""HOT"" this is where a lot of restaurant fails. They served all the food at the right time and in right order. ok now let's move on to what you guys really care about. Items -9/10 :kabsha, chusanut salad. Taste -9/10: I don't believe in perfection but this came pretty close, I would still rate it 9 but I gave 10 for a reason and I'll explain that in a bit. So anyway the chusanut salad really hot when it was served and it was tasty as well. Every item on that platter was upto the mark. Sorry I don't know the name of all the items otherwise I would've explained each item by their taste. Quantity: [10/10]: I don't know how much you can eat but I can eat a lot and I can tell you it's more than enough for 4 person.",1
Its good... The food quality is excellent.. Hope for da best :),1
total enviornment is too good...food is also tasty...,1

One of the best and amazing place. Love the #PeachIcedTea and the food served!!! The environment is lovely and the decoration as well. The food is served in a manner that attracts customers' attention. Worth visiting and a must try...Great Job keep it up (Y),1
Love the place. I'm a regular customer here and I always bring my friends here to try their Gulab Jamun Cheesecake. They also make great wraps and you get to choose what ingredients go into it. This is by far one of the best cafes in Dhaka right now. They have successfully created a fusion between western food and Bengali food. 10/10 would recommend!,1
The main thing I must admire is foods are tasty. I think this should be major thing to measure whether foods are tasty or not. And in terms of peyala place and foods are just awesome.,1
"This one of the best cafes to hang out with friends, I love their coffee more than most places. Their wraps and salad bowls are great too. Amazing service all the time <3",1
Tired their salad bowl and one desert item I just loved both! Saladbowl was so fresh and yummy beyond my expectations! Their behavior is so good and environment is amazing. Highly recommend this place Definitely visit them again ï¿½,1
"I was looking for a quick breakfast after returning from a 2 day road trip with friends, and thought I would give Peyala a try. Had their breakfast burger and mango cooler. Both were outstanding I must say. Staff are friendly and eager to help. My order was takeaway, interior looked cozy during my brief stay there. Very few restaurants in Bangladesh were able to pleasantly surprise me on first visit. This is one of them. Highly recommend.",1
Had peach iced tea. Liked it a lot. Very refreshing,1
Great people work there. they know how to make the customer smile by keeping the smile on their face. The food is always awesome. I would request please add varieties on chicken & beef wrap. I wish them good luck for future!!,1
Best wraps & Tea in town hands down.. Perfect for casual outing & hangouts,1
"Great ambiance! A wonderful place to hang around with friends! I just love their Massala tea and the chicken wrap! the chocolate pastry was amazing too!!! Last but not the least... the hands were amazing! Super active, smart and very helpful boys!! Very kind with always smile on their faces!!I wish them all the luck and a great future ahead!! Keep Going!!!......",1

Loved their service.. The red velvet is one of the bests in town.,1
The reason i am giving 1 star is for the taste of food and prompt service of the staffs. But dear owner please change your location or take a new big place for the second branch.!! And yes your Tea is best in the town :D,1
you hardly find a place in gulshan with such ambiance and reasonable price. loved it!,1

I am not a very good fan of tea but now I am in love with Peyala's masala tea.A great combination of tea with masala. The place is very convenient for me and the behavior of the staff is reallllly really good.They are very well behaved and organized. Usually I don't write review's but this time PEYALA forced me to write something because of their delicious gulab jamun cheesecake and wrap which is very reasonable in price.. This is now like a second home for me.Everybody should at least try their food once.,1
"A very nice place to hang out with friends. Very good food, excellent service.. :)",1

Awesome wraps and one of the best coffees in town,1
A much needed place in gulshan 2! Small but cosy & amazing fusion of flavours from different countries. My personal favorite is their beef kalabhuna. The place gets crammed at times but I can't blame them for that. Highly recommended!,1
"Tried their Chicken Teriyaki and Beef wrap, both were very good! Masala Tea was out of the world for me as i like my tea loaded with milk and sugar . If you are a fan of a gulab jamun and cheese cake then their fusion gulab jamun cheese cake is a must try . It just melt in my mouth .",1
Absolutely love this place! The rastar Chaa is fantastic and the kala bhuna wrap is perfect.,1
Fine food.... fully deshi taste with a bideshi style....loved it....,1
"Really liked the menu and the decor. Reasonably priced. Food, drinks and desserts are simply delicious. Just 2 observations: 1. No rice in wraps please unless customers want it; 2. Rastar cha should have flavour of tea. It was more like gorom dudher shorbot.",1

"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",1
"Sung food garden is really great. Their friendly behavior, hospitality n their hard working are jst awesome I went there last 12 February for my little sis birthday program n it was nice enough for them. The place is very good.

I contacted with them and told what happened and later there was an awesome person from that branch... named Shahid who assured me that he found the mug and asked me to collect it from the cash counter.

"Undoubtedly they serve the BEST SUB SANDWICHES.....Burgers are amazing too! I am keeping sub at top because its completely different then any other sub in Dhaka....unlike all the other sub sandwich places, its not overloaded with sweet mayo & mustard, but the amount is so proportional, u can feel all the ingredients separately....same goes for burgers....its not overloaded with sauce/mayo.....the patty is so fresh, u can feel it in your mouth!!

everything is fine with this restaurant...one of the delicious burger i had in my life..,1

They should check this immediately",1
"Well decorated, tasty foods... not only burgers but also other items..

"Yesterday We've ordered 8 Silanto Chicken. Everyone likes it's flavour specially Marinated Chicken with Herb Rice and Sauteed Vegetables. No doubt food was very healthy, not oily or spicy & they have mentioned that they are not using any kind of testing salt. Personally I don't like too much spice, so the item was perfect for me, even other guys loved it for it's flavour. Another Item was Chat Potato. It's really tasty, not like traditional fries or chat masala type, I am sure they have something secret for the recipe. Really loved it. Want to taste their other item.",1

Just Awesome.....,1
Just loved it.,1
One of the best place to dine... Kebabs are fantastic... very good Hamus... beautiful decorations... set menus are reasonable... must try...,1
"The first glance of the place with its magnificent Lebanese inspired decorations immediately gave out an impression of the middle east. Simple yet subtle. The moment I took a bite of the kabab, I felt like I was back in the Arabian peninsula. The soft arabian music and the lightings and ofcourse the humble waiters dressed in the finest attires helped to complement the feel I suppose. They really did deliver the so called Arab ""ZAYKA"". If nothing else the chefs of this place are some of the finest artists in the world. A 1 star rating would not suffice to describe the experience. I offer them my compliments and look forward to their future endeavours.",1
Finally I loved your Iftar platter. The place is welcoming with quality service. Keep it up! :),1
"There was no reason to go here, specifically, as my friend and I were both on a tight schedule. He had come on a return visit to his homeland from America, and wanted to meet up, after 12 years (for him) and 20 years for me.. also looking for a place near his old house where he grew up. It was just beyond! Meeting a friend after 20 years can be a very, very surreal experience, and I am quite glad that Al-Amar helped to enclose those memories.",1

Last year when I visited Al Amar I was really happy with their service and authentic Lebanese taste. I actually found the Arabic taste same as abroad. Today I had a dinner in Al Amar and still I found the same quality and service. Regarding the taste of the food it's amazing and un explainable. Really recommended and I will inspire everyone to visit Al Amar at least once and try their Mix Grill / Hummus and Lemon with mint(Drinks),1
Yes the over all experience was very good...we went to celebrate our anniversary...the assorted platter was very good...the beef kabab of the platter was a little smelly but they changed it with lamb immediately...highly recommend...Especially the decor very much lebaneese style...,1

Super food and ambiance and at bargain price! Highly recommended! Their half grilled chicken is almost 100% authentic Arab taste and flavour.,1
"Yaa habibi!! The hummus is divine, the tahine thick and rich, and the dÃ©cor and music all transport you to a magical Mediterranean realm. Al-Amar features a wide variety of Lebanese as well as Oriental dishes. True that the price is somewhat above the average range for restaurants in the area, but it's still within reasonable limits given the quality and portions of the food served, and the warm service received. The drinks are interestingly refreshing. We opted for the hummus and kafta antabli (lamb skewers), the ice honey tea and mint lemonade. Not disappointed at all. Very pleasant atmosphere too.",1
"I just loved the food and place as well. We took Hommos, Standard grill platter (chicken & beef), Lamb Mechwe. Excellent taste. Quality was good. Quantity was enough for three.",1

"If you really like to taste fish, this place is definitely a good choice. Compared to other fish restaurants in Dhaka, the prices here are competitive. Additionally, you have a wide array of delicacies. As you enjoy your food, don't forget to see a chunk of our bustling city, which hate and love at the same time. It's a place to be!",1
"""The Kitchen Special"" pizza was terrific! I tried it once, came back uncertain that if it was a fluke or not... but damn, I'm blown away again!

"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",1
"Sung food garden is really great. Their friendly behavior, hospitality n their hard working are jst awesome I went there last 12 February for my little sis birthday program n it was nice enough for them. The place is very good. N the food was very nice. Each n every guest were very pleased by the food they served. Each item was delicious n the friendly behavior n working. Thanks alot manager admin n all officers for making the program good",1

One of our favorite places to have Sehri with friends and family . Love their simplicity yet the deliciousness with the dishes . The Naan Thali is amazing . But the taste of Biriyani in the Biriyani Thali is out of this world . Portion is well enough for one person . I strongly recommend others to take their loved ones to Tarka where you get value for your money and food is extremely tasty .,1
"All stars and I dined there. Had the Iftar here recently and the food was fantastic! I'm not much of a rice kind'a person but I had their mutton biryani with the achar. Superb! Also, during Ramadhan, if you happen to be a fan of ""bundiya"", Tarka is the place to get the best malai-bundiya!",1
I love Tarka and the style of their food! So delicious and Yummy <3 I can't forget!!,1
All stars but I didn't dine there yet. But star dewar karon holo Bangali jati ekhon ek dhonee jati. Karon. Thali originated in south India. Choto belay ekbar madras giye super voy paisilam. Karon oder top khabar hosse thali. Last khabar o thali. Thali oder kase purai vegetarian. Shey ek vivotsho oviggota choto ekti cheler jonno. Jara kina vegetable like Kore na. Kew kore na. So ajkar Dhakay kisu chtoor bebsjahi India theke thali dhakay niye aslo. Asole kine anlo thala o bason. But asol recipeei aney nai. Thanks God. Says today's Dhaka kids. Fill the thalis with beef vhuna and mutton chop and enjoy... It still on thali. So who cares for veggies.,1
"Yesterday I gone there for the 1st time...The environment was so good and so as the food...I loved the palak paneer...it was delicious. In addition, the service was also good...so all stars...keep it up. ï¿½",1

Today i went to your resturant and I felt so comfortable.Your service is very good..your foods are excellent.. your drinks are extremely good....I love your resturant.....Tarka is the best...among all the resturants in Dhaka..<3 to go there.,1
"Its not rocket science as to figure out why i go back to Tarka again & again and during Ramzan, I thought of giving a break but alas! Just had the Jilapi or Jalebi as they spell like this for some weird unknown reason & hands down this is the best in town. Any other argument regarding this is invalid. Period! Also tried their Ramzan Special 'Nan Thali' & its amazing value for money. The taste is as usual superbly trustworthy like their other foods. I actually have to order an extra butter Nan to finish off the nan-thali coz the amount is so much. highly recommend this place during the Ramzan & other times.",1
Nice food...,1
Amazing restaurant with amazing food and with amazing decoration.,1
Good food !!,1
Good quality food with reasonable price............,1

"Dhaka loves Tarka! Great place to Enjoy some good Indian food with Family, Friends and Kids...:) Masha'Allah!",1
"I really enjoyed the environment, the smell of the food from tables. It was mouthwatering. The food proportion on each thali and regular items were sufficient. The kabab and tanduri chicken was juicy, naan was very soft and buttery, Biryani was nicely flavored. The Service was awesome. They served food within 10 mins of ordering. I would love to go there again and have their other amazing items.",1
Best Indian food in Dhaka. Had an awesome time will definitely come back,1
price is high but food is great...,1
"There was a time not long ago when the choice for good authentic Indian restaurant in Dhaka was limited to Sajna and Khazana only, and then came Tarka with their mind blowing ""never tasted"" authentic Indian menu in a casual yet classy ambiance. So far I have tried all of their lunch thalis (except Veggie and Rice, as I am not much into those), and from their regular menu mutton hyderbadi biriyani, chicken lagawab makhani, beef boti, chickten tikka, khusnama kabab, daal butter... fry, matar paneer, mughal chicken, kashmiri/butter/garlic nan and I can't rank anyone better than the other as for their quality is 1 star. As for the drinks my favorite is Jeera Pani. It's also good to see that their service level has drastically improved since their inception and now I don't mind paying the 7% service charge. Also a nice addition was their Iftar menu during Ramadan and particularly the 'haleem' which I fell in love after first sip. I have intentionally held off my review until now as I wanted to test them over time for their consistency which they have proved so far. Keep up the great taste & service and wish you all the best in the business.",1
loved all the food...excellecent...(y),1
My mum is a big fan of Indian food and found the perfect place to take her.... the food is undoubtedly amazing... the thalis gave me a warm welcome to the Indian cuisine.... the hydrabadi biriyani just melts in your mouth!..... I will definitely come back again... specially for the complimentary drinks... haha.... I can still taste it! ^_^,1
yuuummyyyy :D,1
O same food,1
Gulab jamun <3 Yumm :v,1
"I have been looking for an authentic Indian restaurant from couple of years at Dhaka, and Tarka is the answer to my search. Experience is, me being in India, having local food. Price is reasonable compared to the quality.",1
mutton hydrabadi biriyani is excellent...garlic nan n chicken tikka curry are also very tasty...undoubtedly a perfect place for having indian food in the town,1
If i would have chance to mark 10 star i would give...I have no word !!! Just fab !!!! :),1
"today i have lunch here, food and service were excellent, hydrabadi biriani, malai chicken, beef bhuna was great but the king was achari mutton and kulfi. only weak link was lucknow chicken biriani which was a bit dry, yet your all other dishes were so fine and waiters are very friendly that i would love visit there again and again.",1

Tarka should perticipate at Dhanmondi Taste of Dhaka contest,1
Ordered Paneer Dosa ...good ambience and the food was really good. keep up the good work,1
Awesome,1
Given the price it was hard to believe they were able to pull it off....kudos to you guys. Good for a date . Good for a casual hangout or a meet up. Best not to bring family here though as the customer base for this shop is mostly teenagers or people like me with a shallow pocket.,1
"Well as i was born and bought up in this area I had basically tried all kinds of food around this place...so not gonna lie.... Now about pizza....i basically like it cause the crust the flavor all of it is good like if u expect to have a real pizza there are other places for that this pizza is for people who eats outside regularly and want some good food in a cheap rate.This is why i said good instead of 'soo good' Told ya not gonna lie About the place and environment - it's ...a street food court so it's under the open sky.You can bring hr friends and family and have a good time.And as usual there are some overly attached couples who comes here & makes us uncomfortable, i guess if u are not a hypocrite u wouldn't put the blame on this place. In the end all i have to say about this place is ""places with good food and environment is not that available .But this place is all of it "" ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",1
mouth watering pizza..its affordable n very very tasty. quality amount of cheese n other stuffings are find as good in one pizza. smokey flavor is just the hero of it. best of luck pizza live! keep hold ur quality n don't lose ur customers faith..ï¿½,1

A nice and decent place to chill and good food! <3,1

"Massive collection of Bangla Foods. Great food with great taste. Hope ""Vorta Mela"" will go a long way. Best of Luck (y)",1
Delicious food nicely presented with cordial manner.,1
"Love this place! They are a fine dining establishment, with really great food, great service and, as expected, a hefty price tag against every item available. Despite of the feeling of despair I get whilst paying the bill, I still managed to go there a number of times, and haven't been disappointed once However, my latest visit was yesterday, and this time around, I faced a serious problem which prompted me to write this review. We ordered ""Beef Udon Noodles"" which is a fav...orite of my wife, and at the very end of the dish, we found some coiled strings. These things definitely came from the wired sponges that are used for scrubbing the plates when a dish washer is not available. So the person who cleaned the plates wasn't competent, and the chef was not vigilant enough to check this before serving the dish. It wasn't a big deal, but we had a bad feeling. We kind of lost our appetite, and called in the waiter to tell this to his manager. Knowing Bangladeshi restaurants, we weren't hoping for much. However, the manager came in almost running, and profusely apologized. He wanted to replace the dish. But by then, we were full and didn't have the appetite to eat more. So I refused. Then the manager told us that he will remove the bill for the noodles, and we can have any main dish from the menu for free. When I said we are no longer hungry, he said we can also have it made for ""take away"". By then, I was quite surprised. I haven't really seen such behavior from any other restaurant in Dhaka. But then again, I also did not find strings in the food in any other restaurant. But that is not really the point, the point is the nice gesture shown by Umai. After declining this generous offer, the manager seemed sad and apologized again and left. After 4-1 minutes, I asked for the bill, and the waiter informed that we will be served complimentary desserts and then the bill will be given. This was something I could not refuse. So me, my wife and child totally enjoyed the free Banana Katsu dessert (which was the most expensive dessert in the menu) and came out with a satisfied mind. I hope they continue this kind of customer service and improve the kitchen vigilance. I wish them all the best as I want them to stick around and keep on serving us high quality Japanese food.",1
Just love this place...peaceful environment..excellent service and well behaved management! Super like! ï¿½,1
"The salmon belly was absolutely mouthwatering, authentic japanese taste..so was the fresh salmon salad, the dish lives up to its name..the devils breath maki rolls were really good too! All in all, most of the food items are amazing and the overall food experience very good!",1
"Food is awesome, and has some thing special which will drive you here again and again. Visited with my family and had chicken teriyaki, deep fried Seafood, fried prawn, Umai special soup with strip of loin beef and for desert banana kastu. All were very good and unique in taste. Must complement their Japanese Chef and the Umai management. All foods are imported and service is excellent as well.",1
"Far from a conventional Japanese diner, UMAI is haute to the hilt. Purely the name suggests, the menu offers widest gamut of mouth-watering delicacies, including scrumptious sea foods, zesty meats, splendiferous staples, as well as tantalizing desserts. This chiefly Japanese restaurant is one culinary casting that satiate an appetite, and worthy of repeated encores...",1
"Very good preparation - really tasty. Will be coming again as soon as possible. As usual though, food price in Bangladesh is fashionably exorbitant. Umai needs to look into the portion of each serving/ dish.",1
The bento takeaway box was amazing!! loved it! I always love the freshness and quality of all your food. Please keep it up! One of my favorite restaurants (Y) :),1
Some must try items: 1. Umai special soup with strip loin beef 2. Cream salmon sushi 3. Beef teriyaki ... 4. Prawn tempura And the lovely ambience we got for FREE ï¿½,1

Big Belly beef is great with Jalapeno and garlic sauce. Patty was great. Juicy enough to make a mess. Spicy enough to make you cry. Place is nice for Hangouts. Chill ambient. Sunset view is great. Price is 9/10 Worth the experience and the food.,1
"#Big_Belly_Big_Satisfaction ðŸ´ Place || Big Belly Item || I ordered Two Fat Belly Beef ðŸ” & Two Glass of coke. Price || Per Burger 220 & Per Glass of coke 20. Time || Yesterday 10 p.m... Taste || Okay first thing first, Burger was so warm & delicious. Though the bun was soft, I would take it as an average. Loved the Patty & it was totally huge of a size. It was cheesy, juicy and fat enough like its nameðŸ˜ It was their signature burger. Environment || Nice decorated and cozy. Service || Although had to wait for 6-8 minutes but it was worth it. Owners herself asked ""How is the food"" blah blah blah She is nice ðŸ˜ Mistake || Somehow one of my burgers had no slice of Tomato & Onion :/",1

"I m absolutely loved the food, The only thing that Lucknow does better than thier food is their service. Tariq was a super helpful manager, who made sure we taken care of amidst the hustle and bustle during the rush hour for seheri. Its one of the very few restaurants in dhaka who truly cares about thier customer. Cheers!",1
undoubtedly best kabab in the town. every time I visited the restaurant they have made their standards better than before. Consistancy of their food taste and quality is equal yet.,1
One of best Indian food you can find in Dhaka. Gravy is the most recommended.,1
"Let's talk about the place first. Located at the edge of Sat Masjid Road near the Dhanmondi 27 turning, which provides to be central location for people coming in from Mohammadpur, Lalmatia or Dhanmondi. While they do not have a dedicated parking place they try to make up for it by having numerous guards. Interior is very nice. Well decorated, modern and unlike some very dimly lit restaurants opening up nowadays, this proved to be a welcoming experience offering something qui...te on the contrary. The ambience is very inviting with music in the background and ample room between tables to not overhear the conversations from tables nearby. We were a family of four. After being handed the menu which had decent amount of items we ordered a standard Chinese dinner for my parents whilst me and my sister opted for something from the Indian cuisine. We had ordered more than our table of four could accumulate so were moved to a bigger table. Food was served within approximately 20 mins. The food was good, my parents seemed to enjoy the Chinese cuisine and from little of what I tasted i felt the quality was certainly there. My order of tandoori chicken was good but I felt the butter nan to be pretty dry. The owner as well as the manager came around to ask if the food was okay and I let them know of my dry experience of the nan and they immediately changed it. The second batch of nan was much better. Service proved to be admirable and quite helpful when needed. The staff behavior was excellent. All in all it was a great dining experience. A lot of the food we ordered were leftover so we packed it to take home. They gave us a promotional discount but the final bill without the discount seemed reasonable, we were actually expecting the bill to be more but pleasantly surprised. One of the managers actually walked us to our car while leaving. This feeling of exclusiveness felt great and really made you feel the restaurant is keen on delivering good food and service. Hope they are able to maintain this standard in the future. FINAL VERDICT: Location: 9/10 Interior: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Price: 9/10",1

It was not like what I used to have in Abbas Hotel or in Satkhira or in Khulna Zero Point but its one of the places where the traditional food of Khulna region can be found here in Dhaka. It made me feel nostalgic. So, I have no complain about the environment or service :)",1

"Visiting from New York I was skeptical about what I ate. I found this place to extremely hygienic. Being a coffee lover I needed a place where I can grab coffee everyday I tried Gloria jeans and many other but this place serves the satisfying cup of coffee, it is a must have. I also recommend trying the Thai soup and the basil leaf I suggest you ask to put chilies in the sauce, it's a to die for combination with the rice that is slightly sweet. If you're looking for a comfy friendly place to have dinner with it even coffee with friends or family I suggest you come here. Super impressed!!!",1

Amazing place,1
I just had the most amazing experience at Absolute Thai the other day. The Seheri platter is absolutely worth the money. You can have 2 platters only at BDT 810++ and the food is really delicious. Really liked the Chicken Satay and the Prawn Tempura. The Mango sticky rice was a bit weird but really yummy. Way to go Absolute Thai. Going to visit you soon again!,1
The stuff are great and friendly. I arranged a birthday there they helped me a lot. Their food is tasty as well. Specially the sticky rice.,1
"Disappointed ï¿½ I absolutely (#punintended) love to find faults when I'm at restaurants so that I can bash them on their facebook page. But sadly, their food tasted great and their service was actually nice. Unfortunately, they even replaced my red beef curry when they found out I was allergic to aubergine. I was also highly disappointed by their constantly smiling faces. So with great regret I am giving them 1 stars.",1
I thought the seafood with basil leaf was perfect. BEST Iâ€™ve had in Dhaka for sure.,1
"The DECOR of the place is absolutely simple. Nothing very fancy or bright, it's aristocratic. Everyone is well behaved & very welcoming. The DISHES we ordered were the almost regular Thai dishes which was served rather quick in different unique pots & plates. The aroma was spot on from every dish, as you put the Soup, soaked dim sim or even fried sea bass in your mouth it would just give you the burst of correct flavours. The PRICES seemed reasonable for 1:3 main dishes, 1:1 appetizers and deserts.",1
"This is my visit to ""Absolute Thai"". I am very impressed to have excellent mouth watering dishes. Ambiance is very nice and service is appreciable. On the other side, price are a bit high. Anyway, I wish Absolute Thai a great success in business.",1
Took my family for dinner and availed the 10% off that I won from their contest. I was worried about the quality since a lot of restaurants do not maintain food quality when they offer discounts. Thankfully their quality was top notch. Very satisfactory experience. ï¿½,1
great food & service...,1
I tasted their Thai soup.. Dim Sim..prawn fried rice..beef chilli.. Thai soup was too delicious.. Dim sim was awosome. Prawn fried rice was look so nice and also so tasty.. Prawn were well cooked inside.. I really like their prawn items.. Every dish was so delicious and tasty.. And real Thailand Recepie.. I just loved it.. ï¿½,1

one of the best thai food in bd.. in this country we rarely find authentic thai food but absolute thai is just absolutely amazing... after long time I found exceptional taste in Soup... omg...coconut ice cream.. sounds weird but this restaurant has totally changed my perception.. the chef is sooo magical...sooooooo happy after having lunch.. looking forward to see more & more unique food..,1
"Filling Thai food at very reasonable price! Shobcheye mojar bepaar holo jara carb avoid Korte Chao, just order the fish or chicken and have it on its own or share it with soup.",1
"Today i had lunch there with some of my friends. The food tasted good as a whole, took Tom yum soup and mixed fried rich with morning glory, chicken hot besil leaf, fish garlic pepper. That was really very nice. Thai lemon mint & lemon grass was simply mouthwatering. Usually for us Bangladeshies, chinese and thai aren't really different. Because we take the cuisine and tailor it in our own way which doesn't leave much of aurhenticity or difference. And we prefer it rather than the original taste as it is spice laced enough to please our tastebud. But, this restaurant lives up to its name and surprisingly the authentic food tastes much much better than our BD style chinese/thai! Overall it was a good experience...",1
"The food is so delicious, I kept saying wow everytime I tasted another bite.",1
Nice environment....yummy food...liked it so much <3.keep it up,1
"Amazing food, amazing ambiance. Just the perfect place to dine in.",1
"In BD its quite hard to find authentic Thai food as we are mostly recognized with ""Bangla thai"".Here ""Absolute Thai"" surely makes difference.The taste of authentic thai food is absolutely mouth watering. Hope to see more diversity in the dessert options.",1
Food is great! And specially i liked their ambiance. My strongest recommendation is the lemon mint drink. Will be going back again and again for sure.,1

"Great Ambience! Mouthwatering Food! One of the best place to have your lunch at Dhaka, i must say!",1
"Just had an Absolute Feast with my family at Absolute Thai! Started off the evening with the Mixed Appetizers which was great while we waited (considering that it was a packed Friday night, it did take time, but also gave us the chance to chat). The food was brilliant, and 3 hours later, I am still full and can barely move. The Coconut soup with Seafood was my personal favourite! Supplemented by the Dim Sum, an item that appeared to be a Thai Fuchka and Thai Fishcakes dipped... in a Creamy Garlic Sauce, it was a great opener. We ordered loads of items but the Pad Thai, Red prawn and the Chicken with Green Curry particularly stood out. We ended the evening with the (sweet) Lemon Grass juice and the infamous Sticky Rice with Mango (which really lived upto its hype). The restaurant itself is cozy, comfortable, illimunaited and has a classy feel without trying hard. This place is a must for anyone looking for fine dining with quality Thai food.",1

"I went there for a family dinner . Had the set menu with BBQ chicken and naan, and believe me when I tell you I was utterly disgusted to my core as I've never had BBQ chicken or rather any food in any restaurant that bad. The chicken was bland as hell, tasted like a boiled piece of rubber and almost smelled bad . I don't know if they were having a bad day or something, but the most painful thing was it took them more than 0:30 hours to serve that 'Horror in a plate' .My parents had other set menu items which also included BBQ chicken that tasted almost as bad as mine. Though the staff behavior was good it doesn't make up for the bad food and the long wait. I don't know if my experience was an accident on their part or not but it sure was horrific .",0
Today I was parcel 4 crispy chicken fried. I reached my house & some little bit while I am started eat and it is very bad smell & couldn't not possible to eat......another many times same case of other item....sometimes it is really to bad,0
The worst food I ever experienced.. Soup was like steamed water ... And set menu rice chicken are taste less chicken contained heavy food colour.. Which can cause cancer..,0

food quality totally nonsense. Price is ridiculously sky high.don't go there.vooter bari and pizza king much better,0
It used to be one of my favorite places for food but my last three visits were absolute disappointment. The chickens were so dry and tasteless. My favorite charbroiled chicken totally lost its texture and top of that they reduced the size of the chicken pieces. Hope the management take these issues seriously.,0
"Quality and test of food is not great, also food is not well coordinated so you have to ended up paying high for a family dinner. Also they are not transparent when put advertisement as last week they put advert that there will be buy one get one free but didnâ€™t mention time frame so when I reach they told that time is over.",0
"Used to love the food, but recently they have deteriorated very badly. The chicken seem pre-cooked and reheated, and the flavours are not as vibrant. Portions have decreased, too, so I go to Namdo's downstairs instead.",0

Ordered Jamaican chicken with rice...it was a buy one get one offer...rise was tasteless....chicken was dry inside...disappointed...,0
Worst chicken I've ever had ! decoration is up to the mark and that's why people intend to go there.. but the taste of food is not up to the standard! and also the price is so high according to the quality of the food!,0

Worst service i got !! Waiting for 0 hour for the food !!!,0
Worst service ever. I had the worst pizza ever and their price is more than too much.ï¿½,0
No flavor in the overtly expensive chicken. Better to go to the much cheaper kfc or a local chicken joint,0
They serve very small quantities in Uttara branch. They serve 5 time smaller than their Advertisement pic.,0
The food was very bad nd quality nd quantity was very less.,0
Didn't like any of their food at all. Menu full of pages but very little on quality. Don't think would go back again.,0

Worst food in respect of taste and price I have ever tried in any restaurant.,0
Went there two days after the Eid-ul-Azha. The food was not good at all. Specially the rice items were terrible. Their serving was very poor too. Overall - very poor service & food.,0
Taste of pizza was too bad............................ï¿½ï¿½,0
Amount of food was very less in context of price. Food quality was average. They have wifi but didn't give us the password. (For Dhanmondi Branch),0
"The food was the worst.though the service was quite good.we had the jamaican grill with rice.the rice was tasteless,grill was no good at all.",0
Taste: 0/00 Price: too much expensive An overrated restaurant it is!,0
Yesterday me with couple of my friends went there for ifter. The food was cold & may b pre cooked. The stuff's behavior was not friendly at all. We should have soft drinks with the packages but after giving the reminder of 3 times they didn't serve the drinks.,0
The worst F&B service I have ever experienced today. They deliver me like freezing food and even after complain they repeatedly change and deliver the same freezing food for three times. Totally screwed up for Gulshan 0 outlet. :(,0
Iftar platter was too bad. The whole food was served cold. Rice was hard like hell. very disappointed with this iftar platter.,0
Iftari platters are disgusting. Just tried it yesterday at gulshan branch. Tasteless and we all wasted the foods.,0
"Went here today to have Ramadan Meal One (Jamaican grilled chicken) with my family...The meal was absolutely cold and the Jamaican grilled chicken, Chicken shashlik was hard!!! It was not delicious and filling meal at all, rather it was uneatable!!! I went there several times, but didnâ€™t have this sort of experience before. If I knew that I have to eat this shit, I would have ordered the regular menu. It is absolutely cheating.",0
"The food was good. Pasta was poor. But, the no of staff are very less. Can't manage. Don't visit there on Friday. There was almost none to check your requirements. Poor very poor. You pay a lot but you don't get even 00% of the service. Needs lots of improvement in terms of customer service.",0
"One should never order a pizza in this place. It was just below average standard. Home mades are far better than this. Code F 04: They attarct you by writing 00 pieces, but they don't tell you it's only a full chicken. Taka 0465 is not worthy of the plate at any standard of bd, may it be a chain shop. Code GC00: Jamaican chicken was good. Soup was good and had its signature mark with taste. Nice place but congested. ... Parking is a problem as usual. Security guards are eager for tips but has little idea of guiding a vehicle to park.",0
I ordered kids meal for my baby.. and that chicken was smelling like a rotten egg... yaak!!.. and it was the second time that happened to me...they are so irresponsible... very unexpected...,0
Food quality is disgusting. Price .. oh no need bank loan to order a full meal,0
Your design works and campaigns are not communicative.. You should have professional people to handle these... Your FB page page don't represent an international brand sorry to say... And don't you use Olive oil any more!!,0
"We tried four different pizza.all tasted almost same.no salt,no spice,thin crust.the chef should learn how to make pizza.the kiwi chiller just had syrup and sprite in it.not a single piece of kiwi was there.tastes was also not upto the mark. Overall sucks.not coming again.",0
Worst service. The waiters are very ill mannered. Never gonna come back,0
"Went to Gulshan Branch yesterday. I usually like their food but yesterday's service was the poorest! I didn't get 00% discount on SCB credit card though my bill was above TK. 3,000! Had to asked them couple of time to provide the promotional coupon. Very much disappointed!",0
I had the pasta and I think something was wrong with the prawns. I had food poisoning afterwards and was sick. I also asked for butter to put on the bread but they didn't have it. The play area and balloons were nice,0

It was buy one get one offer on pizza. Pizza was disaster. Worst pizza I have ever had .,0
"went at dinner tonight at dhanmondi branch....food was good but I have question about the manners & etiquette of waiters. While I was waiting for my guest after reserving the seats, they asked me rudely as if my guest are coming or not they have other reservation (have to mention that only half an hour passed after I took the seats and half the reserved seats are filled already!!!). After challenging them why they didn't take my reservation earlier when I called, they started... to say they wanted the seats because some ppl just came and ask for seat (I don't see those reservation ppl coming at all that night)....in between the conservation, one waiter said they did 30k per day business as if I give a damn shit about it (30k per day!!! seriously!!! as a brand like yours.......com'on man so poor!!!). After ordering the starter and 0st round of order, they seemed surprised to ask us that 5 person and only 4 dishes!!! REALLY THIS IS THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! If someone order food cost 000tk or 00000tk, both are your customers. You should give your staff proper lesson on manners then let them serve for your brand because its degrading the brand value.",0
"I don't understand why you don't inform your customers properly about your offers for them.it is really unexpected from a brand like you.you tell clearly the offer for pizza will be available on Saturday till further notice.but the truth is different.when we reach your dhanmondi branch after a long busy traffic,you say very easily the offer has ended without prior notice.this is how you serve your customer?don't know what is important to you?customer or profit?speechless... just now I saw some other reviews,I experienced you did the same with some other guests also.",0
"Environment is nice, food and prices terrible. Burger seems like only hot bread.",0
Bit overpriced compared to their taste.Also the interior of dhanmondi branch is nothing special.,0
Not up to the mark service... Waiters insisting having certain items from the menu... Not quality food... n irrational price range!!! Disappointing......,0
"Food was ok but they robbed me by including items in the bill which I have not ordered and did not receive; I went to the cashier and before paying I have told him that I have not ordered this but he says its been billed and he is ""feeling dukkhito"" for this. I had an argument with the manager and was expecting something complimentary but he was also ""feeling dukkhito"" and said will consider me with good service next time as if I am a beggar to beg them for money or anything. I told them you all stole money and that's wrong and I don't live abroad so it does not matter whatever you do next time. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THEM AND WILL NEVER COME BACK WHEN I AM IN BANGALDESH.",0
Dhanmondi branch has the worst quality of food and the worst food quality of customer service. I have never been through such a horrible experience before. And that horrible experience incurred at a very high price. Will never visit again.,0
Food was over priced and not up to the mark in taste! If you are going to charge that much the least you can do is to improve your cooking! The pasta was runny ?!?!???,0
Not good at all....................................,0
"I went to Bailey road branch. The pizza is so poor i felt it was just robbery. The cheese was very thin and the bread was thin too. The topping was also very low in quantity. It felt like , i am having a ruti with some vaji :p The behaviour was good though and that's why i am giving 0 star. Never going to try again unless the food quality improves.",0
"Today we had the most awful experience at BbQ Dhanmondi branch. They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza. Really really disappointed by this ignorant attitude and i doubt i will ever go back.",0
Soft drink 99+vat . :( It is too expensive. Others,0
"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 05 minutes to get the bill and another 05 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",0
"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 0times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 0500 -0600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 0 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 0800tk-0000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",0
Ate iftar platter. Grilled jamaican chicken was good. But fried rice was terrible. Smell of olive oil ruined the salad.,0
"Ripping people off basically. Please kindly take business seriously if not passionately. The management is very poor and the description of their items is not true to its words.

We ordered 3 of the meals of the offer and the food was basically tasteless! Bet they forgot to put salt and a lot of other spices. Overly expensive compared to the quantity and the taste was bad as well. Never going back again!,0

"I ordered Golden Olive Value Meal but I cudnt find anything valuable! Whatever , this combo contains 0pc golden olive chicken ,fried cajun wedge potato, veg rice, egg n salad! At first , they forgot using salt probably :) 0) so far I know with my little knowledge, olive chicken is prepared using olive oil to fry the whole chicken n mixed up with some spices .I neither found any spice nor olive taste. 0) veg rice - hardly got vegetable, dried up rice , less quantity 3) egg ...: even an egg can taste this much worse , I didn't know , forgot using salt here also, as mentioned. 4) potato: the only thing I cud eat at least. Overall experience was worst, this dish costs 345 including Vat.I never hesitate spending if the quality and taste are satisfactory, but this place was irritating enough",0

One of my friends ordered your pasta and didnt even have a bite of it as she was too full, we told the waiters to parcel it but they told us they didnt have the equipment to do so, at that moment the rest of us we stuffed with food so couldnt even taste the pasta or take it home. At the end, we had to pay for the pasta not even eating a bite of it. It was a very disappointing experience of my point of view.",0

Came during rush hour and ordered for 5 people and the service was horrible at best. Got served with ice cold food and waited for it for at least 30 mins. Rubbish. And the managers were damn care about it. Lesson learnt never visit this place when you see lots of cars parked outside!,0
Good for only photo not for food at all. They sell pad thai noodles but in their menu it is written as mixed chawmin. It is not acceptable. At mohammadpur most of the resturent did not charge any vat but they charge vat. Service is tooo slow. Food taste is not up to the mark according to price. Not recommended at all. Set menu taste is so bad that we can't finish it.,0

Risky place for girls as eve-teasers openly tease and employees do not utter a word. Such place should be avoided as they can not ensure safety.,0
Breeding ground for eve-teasers. Girls should steer clear from this place. Guys should also ignore such places that cannot ensure people's safety!,0
Hate this place as they support eve teaser rather than supporting the victims..girls should avoid this place must.,0
A very disgusting environment filled with creeps. The staff doesn't do anything about it. Not a safe place for women. Shit momos.,0
Girls should be careful if they visit yo momos because if u face any eve teaser there they will not come forward they will not give u any support !! Shame on yo momos,0

"Today I ordered some items from Hakkah Dhaka through FoodPanda and my experience was awful! They were not eatable and too oily to digest. On top of that, they were not freshly cooked. I believe they have given us the leftovers!",0
"have no freaking idea why they have decided to take part in restaurant week. on reaching, they said that they won't serve the given menu after 5.30pm. after much discussion they showed some mercy! n decided otherwise. Now for the last 50mins we are waiting like refugees for the food to come... :( :(",0
If possible I would give it a zero. The dhanmondi branch waiters are fraud. Me and my friend took two happy meal to eat and two for parcel. They gave us smelly leftover chicken i guess. They literally lied to us that two plates will get only one kulfi so they cut the kulfi into pieces and served us. For the two parcels they said they cannot give drinks or kulfi instead they would give only one yoghurt. They literally seemed like they didn't wanted to serve us..why?? Because there was no guy with us??...even after inquiring several times they just cheated us by not serving what we paid for.....such theif waiters in a restaurant like hakka dhaka seriously?? Worst behaviour and experience!!,0
Chicken mushrooms was rotten. All food were to much spicy and hot.,0
Come and have food from your worst nightmare! I'd rate maggi noodles better!,0

I wish I can give negative marking.. Was my first time yesterday for iftar... But their way of serving food for iftar is very disappointing. When you fasting your food must be on your table so that you can eat/ate according your choice rather than you just wait for food for their serving. Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food.. The items all were spicy and hot that you couldn't differentiate the taste. And quantity of food was not anyone's desired....,0
"Very poor service, food quality and quantity. Not recommended",0
every dish is cooked with sugar.....not good......foods should be more spicy,0
Most disgusting food in a noisy place and full of rude waiters.,0
"Me and my wife went there on Baishakhi afternoon to take there Favorite meal (tk 499) meal platter during odd time. The platter was offered from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm and we delayed our lunch just to have a taste of it. We thought to take the alternate options in our two platters so that we could have a chance to taste all the options. But when we went to order, the parser refused to give alternate options and replied that they do not take order for single platter. Even he repli...ed that if we ordered for single platter than they would refuse to serve so but it was not mentioned in anywhere in their flyer. The attitude of the parser was unfriendly. However we placed order. Then the manager came and roughly asked whats my problem. When i explained to him the issue, he became somewhat soft and said sorry. The food came. The rice and spaghetti became normal temperature and did not taste well. The mongolian beef and wrapped shrimp was good. Chicken mushroom was average. The special kulfi was good but not that much special... Overall FOOD was different, taste would be better if served hot, has areas of improvement.. Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness was better.. But SERVICE is poor, promotional offers should be carefully designed, and the servers and managers should learn how to stay polite when they are in the wrong side of any debate... However I will go there/order online another day to get the taste of other items...",0
The worst food I ever had. I will never go there again and I suggest no one should.,0
Sue the chef...worst food ever,0
sorry to say had a bad experience...food was cold and disgusting....never going there again,0
"Except for the beef noodle, the wings and prawns were trash compared to their previous quality",0
Ordered the PLATTER-B worth of 0300 for 0 person.. And here's what i think 0) Rock-hard beef. I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 0) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,0
foods are too spicy & oily and overpriced too. some waiters have problems with their attitude.,0
"Today me and my wife went there to have iftar and taste their Hakka food. All the seats were empty at 5:30 pm,still they said all seats were booked after hearing that we were only two persons.So, it is clear that if we were more than two, then all the booked seats would have been empty....... If u can't make arrangement for couples then hang a sign mentioning that ""no couples seats available""",0
Went there yesterday.... Faltu food quality... rice er modde chul.. seriously.. ykkkk.. tu... totally money nd time loss...,0
"I have tried out their lunch boxes worth 300 tk which comes with rice /noodles & 0 items. The rice named egg fried but I doubt they even used a full egg for the whole meal as I ordered 00 boxes! Dry chilli beef was chewy, worsted was the chicken with cashew nut, sweet & too salty, the said it a 'Lunch' box but the quantity of rice was enough for my seven year old nephew only. Too poor food for the price!",0

"30 December0005, I think something mistake about to guest service from service persons & kitchen. Foods not proper cook & tasty ,Not warm & well decorated. Service personâ€™s concentration not properly to guest. Not Clean Table swiftly after finish foods. Price not reasonable by service. But Mr.Owner is caring to guest service properly. ... Hope will be better service by reasonable price Foods ,Quality, Quantity & Decoration. Good Luck & Thank you Mr.Navid.",0
Too much spicy food.... There is only black pepper in the dishes.. I am not satisfied at all.... :/,0
Went there yesterday... ordered mega platter for 0. Except the prawn warps nd yogurt delight each nd every dish was.. over cooked..tasteless. We were really disappointed . Also about the service.. the behavior of the waiter was annoying.. not well mannered.,0
à¦¹à¦¤à¦¾à¦¶ :( :(,0
Food was below expectation.... So spicy and ordinary...really disappionted,0
"The interior of the restaurant was not attractive, food was good but not excellent, waiters should be more polite, some of them were rude. Food was overpriced, and I found HAIR in the food. However, could not notify them ,since I was in hurry.",0
"Went to Hakka Dhaka at Banani yesterday and had to say , the service and the behavior of the man in charge was not good . Went there at noon and maybe they were busy about Iftar services , but as I with my friends went there , the man In charge acted like we are not welcome there at all . never had to experience such bad service like that in other restaurants !",0
food is not good at all !!!................ .......,0
Worst food & unnecessarily expensive with too poor quantity ... Just yakk!!!,0
"Hearing all the high praise, today we booked a table at 9:05 pm and the receiver warmly confirmed the availability. Once we reached on time there was no free table and we were asked to wait. After sometime we left, till now didn't get a call. Food may be great, perhaps need to work on service.",0
"The worst food ever tasted. I've eaten Hakka cuisine in so many far eastern countries. .....this one has burnt my lips, tongue, throat and stomach.",0
Food too sweet and spicy.,0
"Food test is very bad, if that food would have been in a small restaurant no body said good words about that but as it has a fancy name that's why (may b) people say many many good words. it is the most worst food they serve, total bill was 0070 tk.",0
"Very very bad food quality and no hygiene.. there was big hair in chicken, it felt like they marinated the chicken with the hair! Yuck! ðŸ¤®",0
"one of the worst experiences of going to a restaurant in bangladesh was yesterday - completely ruined my lunch! a juice took 00 minutes to arrive and even after the chef being told how to modify an item on the menu, the wrong food was served! things got from bad to worse and I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE AGAIN! places like this should be shut down!",0
"Didn't have a good experience at all. The foods and services are no value for money, not even half. The worst part was, we found hair in one of the chickens",0
"I think they have the worst service ever. They have no generator. So when the electricity goes down, they can't provide you any fried food. Moreover, they can't even provide you extra fans. But their food is really good. So if you only care for quality food, then it's worth a try.",0
"Shitty service! no lie.. the scheme is to rob customers off with overpriced juices and not even an option for soft drinks, on top of that water temperature is normal. Who wants to sit in a tiny area with a big group, eat some spicy food and combine it with terrible service and normal water Chicken steak was good. that's about it. Never visiting again.",0
Ya honestly food is yummy but according 0 da price food limit ws shit.....Environment ws good....lighting and decorations not enough.....food is good bt limitless.......n juices r not at all good....evn thy dont hav a large water bottle.....,0
I just hated this place and regretted why I wasted my weekend dinner by going there. The food was so spicy that none of us could even eat. When I asked the manager why the food was done spicy without asking us in Advence they have replied that their food taste like this. So if the food is like this I don't want to visit this Resturant even again.,0
Expensive food but very little place and service is not up to the mark at all,0
"I didnt like it coz its too much price high acording to the food n quantity, the taste of rice totally sucks!! N u shud giv sausages instead of mushroom!! N also the place is too small!! N plzz get some drinks instead of that tasteless highly priced juice.",0
I just hated this place and . The food was so spicy . I don't want to visit this Resturant even again.overpriced.....wrost service! and not even an option for soft drinks....,0
The food is too spicy. Only people who love street foods and can digest anything garbage can enjoy here. I got sick after eating their food. Not going there anymore.,0
Jaaa-taaa obostha ! Management bole kisu ase ? Manus kano je ekhane jay ! Maaf chaisi bhai ar jaitam na. They are too late at everything,0
"I would've given them a 0 star but just because their food is too good,I'm giving them a 0 star rating.Not to mention they have the worst service and can't provide you a fan when there's no electricity :) Food-00/00 Service-0/00",0
just a horrible place.... I'll not visit there anymore... food is average bt price is damn f**king high..... a rubbish restaurant...,0
we took sirleon steak platter but steak was burnt outside and raw inside.,0

Service was not up to the mark compared to food price....,0
"Joghonno khabarer taste, joghonno. Taka panite fellam.",0
"I have never tasted any strawberry juice or orange juice worse than that >_< The Strawberry mujoto and Fizzy Orange were the total waste of money. The only 0-3 sip from those were just punishing! However, Mr. Crab Salad was eatable. .... Not recommended if you are a food lover and value your money",0
Waited for 0 hour 30 mins for the food..they kept on saying 5 mins 5mins so later on decided to walk out,0
The restaurant is okay. The decor is decent. The stairs are totally unsafe. The menu... it has a lot of flaws. Starting with the lack of fizzy drinks to not being able to order extra sides. Not everyone wants to drink juice with a steak. I know I don't. I had to get those mini water bottles you all have that taste extremely bitter. Try to get Mum and some other mineral water brands since getting water is the only option for people who don't want those juices. Also what am I s...upposed to do if I want extra wedges? Order an entire lemon chicken platter for those 5 pieces of wedges that come with it? The menu is extremely inconvenient. The platters were decorated okay. Looked aesthetically pleasing. The wedges were the only decent sides. The rice was somewhat okay too. The mashed potato and mushrooms weren't up to the mark. I had expectations from this place and I am disappointed.,0
I loved it bcoz of its taste but now it's totally change and quantity reduces.....sad feelings,0
Mr. Crab Salad sucks. Big time... Lemon chicken and bbq chicken were ok. And overfuckinpriced.,0
They don't maintain time this is their bad side yesterday they served our food after 0 an a half hours later that's really bad service !!! Food is also not satisfactory,0
The standards have decreased from before and the size of the dishes have decreased enormously! I was disappointed!,0
"Very expensive, insufficient quantity, not very spacious, stairs for restaurant is not safe, insufficient lighting inside, plates made of wood & must be very old so feeling health insecurity, however food seems to be ok with my family - they liked it. Need development of the mentioned issues to make me feel visit another time.",0
taste was good i must say but their price is extremely high!!!! behavior is not up to the mark. . .there were no soft drinks except their extremely pricey juice menu...service was very poor!!!!!,0
"much hyped restaurant but the food taste was horrible, over cooked & salty. Ambiance was okay.",0
Previously I Gave 5 Star Rating And Recommend All My Friends This Place. But Today i Went There For Hang Out. Food was Completely Disgusting. I Ordered Beef Bento & The Steak Was Fully Spicy Not Properly Cooked. Mash Potato Was Not Properly Blended. and Don't Want To Talk About The Rest Of The Food. This Restaurant Used To Be Awesome But Somehow They Let Their Customer Down. I Never Coming Back And Don't Recommend Anyone Anymore To Ruin Their Evening.,0
"food was quite ok but menu is too short. Didn't get the point why don't they serve soft drinks when their juice aren't up to the mark. & the rest room, my goodness, it was overflowing. I was so shocked.",0
"Though the ambience of the restaurant was good but the food which matters the most let the restaurant down. I had the beef bento. The steak was over cooked, mashed potato was horrible (which almost made me puke) and I didn't like the mushroom as well. To me the buffalo wings lacked flavours. The only good things in the platter were the prawns and the salad. Again I had their pineapple juice which was way too grainy. They really needs to improve.",0
the sitting arrangement is not good.. the place is too small.. they couldn't offer cold drinks and the food was not up to the mark,0

"This is regarding dining experience at Tree House last night(08th September 0005).I am disappointed that I could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old.We waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 0 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from).I personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story.Anyway,maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place,I will never frequent this place again.",0
Food was ok but their way of handling bill isn't very responsible.,0
Horrible customer service stupidest one ever never coming back,0
"Limited food menu, food taste average, too small place.",0
Very poor service. Comes with raw food and blood yuck! Don't even have enough glasses to serve people. Good luck if you visit,0

I waited more than 0.69 hours and still the pizza wasn't served.,0
"Seeing the location felt good about the cafe but they were renovating so very few customers which is why asked if they will be able to serve and the staff replied yes. To our surprise they served old and smelly chicken in their BBQ set menu to both of my colleagues and burnt mushroom to me one by one with serving the third meal 40 mind after ordering. Upon complaining they discounted 37 or 47 taka from the bill silently, which only shows they knew what they were serving and still went along with it. Very disappointing. Won't visit again and will suggest my Peers to do the same.",0
Very bad behavior. We asked for a mineral water and they gave us a local brand (ps:never heard of that company) . The cap was broken and expire date was removed. But they claimed that we broke the cap. We returned the water bottle. Then they immediately gave us the bill. We didn't even ask for the bill.,0
"The environment is good. Close to d nature with lakeside views. I can't comment about their foods. Though it's d Cafe for triangles, but sometimes other clients they've whose come here to pass their time lavished ways. During my jogging session I observed that. Behaviour of staff well as I had observed yesterday when I had popped in during d heavy rainfall. I have tested Coffee, that's really hot & nice. I enjoyed. Thanks to Cafe management authority.",0

decoration nice. place also nice but we ordered chicken chowmin but there were not a single bite of chicken. After asking of mine they answered its too small in size to see. other dishes were average.,0
"Went there yesterday. Decoration was good having a seperate family lounge. But there service was staggeringly poor. We ordered kacchi platter (5 persons) including chicken roast, beef tikka, firni, jarda and borhani. When the dishes came we discovered that there was no mutton in the kacchi!!! When called, the waiter told that it was a mistake and brought all the muttons together in a seperate bowl. Two pieces of mutton for each person and the pieces were very tiny. the firni was like baby food (semolina) and there was no raisin in it. Jarda was of no difference. Above all, the food quality was nowhere near the quality of the one in Rampura. only there ambience and the borhani compelled me to put a 0 star. otherwise I would have given a one.",0

Outfit is gorgeous but inside ...!?! To get in here is only spending money eating nothing.",0
It was my first time there . First impression is last impression. The place was narrow and room was small . Food and service ruined my mood of having party. Washroom was out of water for few minutes. Its never depend on name you're given bt also its inside food and environment,0
The food was barely eatable. The chicken fries were as hard as wood. And the other foods were full of flour and less prawn & beef.,0
The worst Chinese restaurant in Bangladesh. They don't even know how to cook chilli beef or simple fried rice!!! Stay away ... honestly do not spend your money on this junk!!!,0
The waiters have the worst behaviour and service i have ever received from a classified hotel like Royal Orchid. i highly recommend you change your waiter body or teach them minimal manners.,0
Worst food I've ever tasted. Also the behavior of the stuffs was disgusting. They just put me on shame in front of my family. First and last time. -_-,0
Average food and really bad service. It was my first and last time there.,0
Taste of their food is poor.service is also zero.,0
Your pasta taste is not so good. Good quality cheese should be added,0

I explained it's the meal that I ordered. He was going back and forth... He seemed confused. I told a trainee standing next to him to ...call someone senior, the manager so that I can explain. She told the cashier instead. And he got agitated. He showed the fries pack and started saying you ordered 0 pcs chicken. The guy standing to him stepped in and took my order. He remained silent as he exchanged the cards... no thanks or apology for the confusion... nothing. To make it worse... he came upstairs after a while to clean up and kept exchanging eye contact couple of times. Don't want to put his name in public. Would be happy to inbox.",0
On 06 February we visited KFC Satmasjid Dhanmondi branch and waited over one and a half hours. This is really deplorable service for a restaurant that claims to be serving fast food. Staff were not even apologetic and blamed equipment. If equipment was faulty management shouldâ€™ve made alternative arrangements. Poor management. Poor service. Poor attitude. In addition the restaurant was very shabby and unclean.,0
Mirpur outlet was horrible. I took a fiery grilled chicken and it tasted very bad.,0
"High price with cheap quality. I went their Poton, Gulsha or Baily Road outlet. All are same. Even their serving amount not sufficient.",0
As rider was not available I myself came to KFC Paltan for 0 God father burger@ 400 tk offer. They informed me it's not available in their outlet. What's the point of such offer if u can't provide full information.

"The steaks are a lot to be desired of..typical local rubbery meat. Dry. When I asked if medium would have pinkish hue, they said it would but at serving was well done. Perhaps that's why steaks were rubbery. Side dishes were okay..liked the mashed potatoes. Probably wouldn't recommend.",0
Space is too small. We ordered Texas Tornado which was awful! No taste at all. Then we ordered Poutine. I asked for little salt and pepper. They couldn't give me Salt. Poutine was not up to the mark! Then we had Sirloin Steak Medium cooked which was okay type. They even forgot to serve my drink. Overall i didn't like it at all.,0

I went to Woodhouse Grill on Friday and was shocked to see such a small restaurant with no space between tables. It seems the tables are joining each other. Their prices are quite expensive considering that this is a very small restaurant in a small congested space. The service was poor. We were told that the food would arrive 45 mins. after ordering but the food arrived later. I suggested the owner to serve all the food together at a time instead of serving each order separ...ately. We ordered a t bone steak medium well which was brought out medium rare with blood remaining inside. We also ordered a sirloin medium well which was very dry. The steaks are kept frozen and after cooking it was not at all juicy. We also ordered grill chicken which was ok. The waiters are not well trained and don't know when to serve the drinks which should have arrived right after ordering but instead I had to remind the waiter yo bring out the drinks almost 30 mins. after ordering the drinks. Its a ok place but they need to improve service quality and better quality steak.,0
I had the Tomahawk steak yesterday. It looked incredible but tasted disaster. Their service was good. Worst sauces ever I tasted. The place is too small and congested.,0
I had the Tomahawk steak last week. It looked incredible but tasted disaster. I asked for medium but they cooked well done for me. Their service was good as they cooked a new one but for my utter disappointment the second one was medium rare. Both the time the meat was really chewy and the mash was too sweet. The place is too small and congested. They should work hard on improving their cooking of the steak.,0
"Went today during iftar time and ordered their iftar platter 0. They didn't serve panna cota which was included in the picture given in the page. In their list, there was fruit salad but they served two pieces of malta in the name of fruit salad. We ordered five platters but they served only three raita salads for each platters. I have been a regular customer of this restaurant and I can say that the quality of this restaurant is decreasing. The rice was not well cooked and vegetable was tasteless.",0
"Had a bad experience at FoodBuzz banasree. Yesterday I went there with my family. As all the tables were filled up we waited for some time. Then one table was empty and the waiter accommodated us that table. But a little while later when we were about to order food the waiter came and said this table was booked and we must leave it. They wanted us to give another table but there was no Air Conditioning there. So we had to leave the restaurant. Before leaving I told the incident to the man sitting in cash counter. But none of them simply apologized for it. Its only because of traffic jam and lack of good restaurants in banasree, we have visit such third class restaurants who do not even know what is customer service. This was my first and last visit to this restaurant.",0
"tandoori chicken dry, butter naan has no trace of butter, dry as well.",0
The only redeeming quality of Foodbuzz is the friendly and polite service. Unfortunately the first experince for the wife and I was terrible. I personally doubt I will come back anytime soon. P.S. I am intentionally keeping the review vague.,0
Unfortunately I didn't like the behaviour of manager. I'm leaving my number for the owner 00754-747474. Please call me so that I can give you some valuable advice. Thanks but I'm not coming again.,0

"Update about the Rating: This was one of my favorite place for hanging out with fnf. But faced something awkward and irritating in my last visit. Totally unprofessional behavior, if there's some problem to serve a specific item to me then it's better not to serve the same item to other while I am in your restaurant. I tried to order a specific item but the server said this item is not available, ok cool. I have gone for another item. but a Minute later I could see and hear t...hey were taking the same item's order from the next table. I didn't want to complain about the mismanagement at the cafe as some other visitor was there, I thought it would be better If I write it down to their complain book, so I asked for their complain book but they don't have a feedback or complain book. OMG. Rather the server insisted me to complain the problem to him directly, I denied and later the manager or accountant came to explain the scenario. Now come to the food part: I had ordered ""Schezwan Chicken, Rice"" and ""Mongolian Beef"" where the quantity was really poor and it doesn't even close to Schezwan Chicken's look or taste. Mongolian Beef's beef was hard to chew and again quantity was poor too. Old Rating: I will recommend this place to have the Fresh Juice and French Fries there. Reasonable price and comfortable couches to hang out with Friends. All the Other items I have tried need more improvement (Burger, Sub Sandwich and Regular Sandwich).",0
Today we were the very first customer in the morning of Eid. We ordered and we were told we will get our foods within 00-00 minutes . But we had to wait more than 40 minutes for our food. We repeatedly told the waiter and he said that the foods are on its way. Whereas the second customers came they ordered milkshakes and ice creams. And they were spontaneously served.

"No bean, no corn, no salsa in Mexican bowl. If you donâ€™t add those ingredients then why mention in menu? Even tried quesadilla which was just chicken and some sauce and cucumber.. quesadillaâ€™s main ingredient is cheese .. may be you guys donâ€™t know that.. You should call it fried rice chicken tehari.. people who never tasted Mexican food might like it but i now know your food sucks big time and no where near Mexican taste.. waste of my money..",0

"While I'm a big fan of your food, I ordered a salad bowl via Pathao today and was disappointed. The packaging was an absolute mess and very disproportionately sized. Difficult for anyone to comfortably eat, you should work on a better way to deliver one of your signature items",0
Sorry to say their Readymade tea is not so good what I expect from them ï¿½ Nd their pealacchino s the worst coffee ever. I will not go there #never_ever. It was an worst experience for me n my frnd.,0
It happened twice that they failed to deliver food even though orders were accepted. Pathetic to say the least...,0
"I remained a regular fan of their salad bowl, but now I m very dissapointed with the quality of serving...the decrease the amount of the ingredients of salad....even I told to put more chicken, mashroom and fajita,but they didn't do it...amount of ingredients are far decreased than before...really upset.",0
Really poor service.Don't care about customer.It feels like they are giving everything free. I will suggest others nt to come here,0
very cheap,0
"Food was dry and tasteless. The tea was worse than many road side tea stalls, and they gave like two drops of tea in a 50 tk cup. Absolute waste of money. Please leave this place be.",0
The quantity of salad bowl has drastically decreased. In-fact today there was no coleslaw on the salad bar(They said its over :( ) . I am not going back to peyala again.,0
"No opinion , about worst Restaurant.",0
"The tea is overpriced but taste is good, specially Masala tea. The quantity is really small for 50 taka.",0
Shitty place,0
"Yesterday was my first visit here & it was not a pleasant one. I had to wait over 35mins for one masala chai & the place was relatively empty. Even worse, a person who ordered the tea much later than I did, received it earlier. The cafe in itself reminded me of a smaller version of Chipotle and the prices were reasonable. However, the efficiency of the staff were simply not up to the mark & I honestly expected better service.",0
"Tried their red velvet,no where near kiva hans or red window, As well as choco coffee,it had choc n coffee in it,but wasnt desirable either,dissapointed in quality",0
what a food brand....what e service!!!...its 8.00 pm....not a single food available... no wrap and no salad....even your people don't know when it can available to night....this is shit...(I think you should pay my car fuel cost),0
"I ordered a ""Boro"" Masala Tea. Considering the price and the taste, it was not value for money. It was no where near to what one would consider as Boro. Plus the menu on the wall mentions it comes with a biscuit. When I asked for one, they said it is not available yet and they don't have alternatives :/",0
One of the worst never go there please I beg you . They serve in fucking tiny portion- just order the big tea and you will know what I am trying to say,0
"Worst Tanduri chicken & butter nun I have ever had. tanduri chicken was burned to core and hard as rock! Overpriced (Tanduri chicken tk 060, butter nan tk 40) and stale quality. Even the salad served was stale and smelly. Seems like they have started to take people for granted!!",0

"The place is clean and the staff are very friendly , however I believe the management is very stingy. Most of the menus were 6 pieces ( pen corrected from 8.) instead of 8 pieces. The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 00). I would spend my money some where else next time.",0
Worst Chinese food. I will never eat. If you have to waste money then go there.,0
"When i was a kid i used to go there every month, amazing environment amazing food and the service, felt nostalgic after a decade i went there now and was very much disappointed.....service was bad, restaurant was damn noisy even after 00.30pm. Cheap quality food, once my fav soup tasted like vomit -_-. Felt really sad and disappointed.",0
By eating in the sung food garden I have been vomiting 3 times It is the worst Chinese restaurant.i have been the victim of food poisoning in this Chinese,0
They makes Horrible thai vegetables!!service is bad!!00% service charge+05%vat!! Not worthy of anyone's money and test bud!!,0
Absolutely boring and it was not hopeful food quality is very much bad & unexpected !!!,0
I got sick after taking lunch. The food was stale.,0
The food is below average. Their service is terrible. And they took forever to serve even the starters.,0
Service charge and vat ............is to much.......,0

"Worst than the worst Iftar platter I had yesterday with my colleagues at Gulshan 0 branch and none of them said anything different. when u complain about their food they'll tell you that they maintain food quality religiously in this month of Ramadan. Everyone likes food to be served hot, u don't need to remind that to your customer. Accept that you are of no good quality, there are plenty other good coffee shops in the town. We eat the food not the franchise. Iftar platter... had bland chicken hariyali kebab, fish fritters were way too much fried and cold, spicy grilled chicken with the friend rice was actually without any spice. I am sorry to say it was overall tasteless. Coleslaw with the chicken lemon oli was sour and inedible. I always had good expectations on GJ regarding food but you guys just did a very bad job in this month of Ramadan. Couldn't resist myself to make a point on it. Hope you guys will work on it.",0
"There was a time i gave it 5 stars. Used to be my favourite place to go!But ever since the whole team is changed including the chef of the dhanmondi branch, it has gone down terribly. From the food to service .. everything has gone under expectation. I am a regular customer and still want to be but the whole team needs to have a good come back! Otherwise will loose all interest going there 0/3 times a week! Already started to go very less! Keep your heads up and try sort out the issues",0
"Used to hangout daily at their Dhanmondi outlet on a regular basis. But the quality of their coffee went down sharply. Went there few days back after a break of many months, and the quality deteriorated even further. It's a coffee place that coffee lovers should avoid at any cost. The review is only applicable for drinks related to coffee and not their food or deserts.",0
"Gloria Jean's was one of my fvrt place but i will never be there. Most worse food, i had yesterday on iftar. Food was cold, not tasty, amount was poor. The place was so crowd and noisy.",0
"Worst iftar plater I have ever had..cost me 500tk but food quantity & quality was very poor..I would recommend not to go there for iftar, its just waste of money..",0
Service is getting worse day by day. And now it's getting even horrible as they have started taking orders from tables. They do not know how to manage orders. A total mismanagement with ineffcient staff and a complete waste of time.,0
Wish FB had negative rating. Sad to say that it's one of the WORST experience regarding reservation. Hard to believe it's an international brand.,0
"The day before yesterday was the last day i went to this place, there is no centralized system in there management, different people give different information, which create confusion. They should maintain proper centralized customer service system.",0
"I was wondering, why there is a BIG KABAB in a burger which cost TK 648, in the menu...where it says BIG BEEF BURGER, I think it should be BIG BEEF KABAB BURGER...Don't you guys think, you should make it more clear in the menu....???",0
"00 mins wait for a take away double cappuccino, only to get the wrong order. Less than 00 customers, but terribly service.",0
Not expected from you. So why do you charge this much? For outdated ingredients? Really Shameless!!!,0

"this is the only coffee shop in dhaka, where they took 05% vat...... & that is not include with food.... u will see one prize, but when u pay that is another prize........ funny.......",0
"worst lasagna in milky-way. served on top of french fries / chips. Sandwich was good. they will push for the food and, Drinks was below average.",0
"The food is made from frozen ingredients, not from fresh ingredients. That completely changes the taste. Also, the cakes are very dry. For the price they charge, they need to be much much better.",0
You should make the supplementary prices more visible in the menu. The writing about supplementary charges is soooooo small it goes unnoticed. It creates a wrong perception about the prices,0
"Worst fish platter worst vegetable,,in my lyf ihv nvr tasted such a worst veggie nd waisted so much money on a bougus food,,the veggies were raw nd no salt ws dre in it nd they served fried crumbed fish fillet which they call it as grill mayb they dnt knw da meaning of grill!

taking pictures with a flash isn't a sin :) a customer might find it harmful or distracting. But after moving to another place to take the picture and hearing another complain and restrictions for the same reason is a harassment.,0

When approached your cash counter lady, it seemed apparent that this was intentional & she was dumb founded as someone actually bothered to read the receipt! To top it off she charged us for the free coffee that we were entitled to off the loyalty card. And when asked for a manager, her colleague presented himself to be the one..LOL! I am not sure because of where you are located, you feel privileged to rip off your paying customers & assume we are a bunch of idiots, or that we won't bother with your microscopic itemised ""imported receipts!"" I recommend you use a fund raising box if you are so desperate. At least we will know the local CafÃ© is not trying to take us for a ride!!!

I don't need your stupid staff to blabber in their grammatically incorrect English with a funny accent. I just wanted to practice ordering in Bengali since the location of this coffee franchise was in Bangladesh! The coffee itself wasn't too bad although not too special given the price !

And what do you mean when you say to your customer that there are CCTVs, so DO NOT SIT IN CLOSE CONTACTS? Why don't you put a notice or distribute pamphlet If you want your customer to follow such a CODE of CONDUCTS that is not against YOUR FAMILY VALUE? Do you think a boy and a girl go to Gloria Jean's to KISS EACH OTHER... in PUBLIC? How could it be against the FAMILY VALUE if two people sit together grabbing each other's hand? Do you think two people can get enough close that would look unusual in your arrangement?",0

"Gloria Jean's Coffees Bangladesh- it's a coffee shop where coffee tastes horrible and other dishes taste quite well. They don't even concentrate on improving the taste of the Coffees. They are constantly trying to improve other dishes which are easily found in other ""restaurants"". I repeat ""Restaurants"". Last I checked Gloria jeans is not a restaurant, it's a coffee shop. My question is- Has Gloria jeans become a restaurant or is it still a coffee shop? You guys are selling... deserts, fried rice, burgers and many other things very efficiently and they taste quite good as well. But when it comes to your coffee, they taste like shit. I have been going there for a long time and it's unacceptable from a great coffee shop like this one. I have been going to various coffee shops for a long time and that's how I developed a keen taste for Coffees. I know the variations of Coffees and the taste of them. In other coffee shops, the variations of coffee is quite amazing. Here one day I ordered ""cafe mocha"" and it tasted as usual. The next time I went there, I ordered a ""cappuccino"". I couldn't even differentiate between those two because both of them tasted the same. There is no depth and aroma in these coffees. If I can't find the variations among the different types of Coffees, then why the hell anyone should come here to taste these horrible Coffees with such high prices? They certainly maintain a standard about other dishes and they taste really good. But as a coffee shop, they don't deserve to get a rating of 0.",0

totally dissatisfied their service. we order panipuri but it is full out of test. chiken pakura is look like beguni. better improvement is needed.,0
"I've been there before, but last day's experience was really annoying. Ordered 3 items, got 0 of them in time, and the bill as well..not serving another items in time, but including them in bill made me pissed off really bad..and the excuse that they ""forgot"" about the order! how can you forget your service order but remember to put them in bill..really?",0
"One simple word, Frauds ! We ordered 'pakora' they gave beguni with cheese!! We ordered 'pani puri' they gave fuchka! There is difference between pani puri and street fuchka, and between cheese-beguni and pakora ! it was misleading ! If you cannot make something, please don't sell something else under that label.",0
"Too salty food. We couldn't find any difference, in terms of taste and appearance, between Masal Dosa and Butter Masala Dosa. Although the price was 50+ more for the later one.",0
The food was really bad. It was almost painful to eat those stuff. Never going back there for sure :(,0
I was a terrible environment with terrible service.,0
Completely waste...will never go there again for sure..the idiotic stuffs made it a complete package of waste....,0
"their behaviour was not good at all.. so if anyone wants to go there and wants to spend some good time with friends, i think it would be a bad choice.",0
I expected some good Indian food and snacks. But this place is not up to the mark in terms of Indian cuisine.,0
i had doi fushka. have to say yogurt was quite sweet. and one more things staffs are not friendly that much. i was shocked before i often went there and had a good warm welcome from them . but m sorry to say that that warm welcome now don't exist .,0
Stupid staffs. They don't know how to talk with customer !! Food is ok. But am very unhappy about the behavior of their staffs.,0
"Worst food I ever had. First of all I ordered 00"" pizza but it was hardly 9/00"". The crust was very hard & thin just like a chips & the toppings were really poor & there was no flavor! We complained but they didn't respond at all!",0
"Worst food...... very much disappointed with the quality of the food. Service was really bad. They served 9 inch pizza and when we complained they said "" It is our 00 inch pizza."" Like seriously!!! Do they have separate or unique measurement scale!!!!",0
Worst service despite reserving it from before. Not to mention the food was totally opposite of what the actual Iftar platters looked like.,0

We were done with the chicken pop by 8 00 nd at 8 05 they sent the coleslaw nd burger. It looked terribly funny that yet they dint give the wings. What m i supposed to have the coleslaw with . Your head? I finished the burger at 8 35ish ns went to the counter asking them bbq wings kothay. They said 7 more mins. I said ill take take away nd asked them to take back their coleslaw. They agreed. But when they took it back the waiter said sorry aita khawa. I said impossible. U have to take it back. If necessary pack the wings with a mountain dew. But what will i do with ur ckoslaw served this late with burger. Keu ki burger diye coleslaw khabe. ? Ok finally they agreed again. When i was leaving with the bbq wings nd mountain dew. They offered a 05 tk exchange. I said keep it. And very rudely they said no i wont keep ur money. Take it. I angrily said i wont nf statted to walk away. 3 ppl near the kitchen screamed at me saying never come back. Now let me ratw ur food. Shake was ok. 9/00 Burger was disgusting. 0/00 Chicken pop was 5/00 Um yet to have the wings but ur horrible experience wont allow me to digest ur food. I am never coming back nd i know it wont bother you. Thing is. The person i went at your place with said quite a few times to go nf sit sumwhr nd i replied na its a good place naam shunsi. Baki gular naam o shuninai. I wont ask ppl not to go thr. I will ask ppl to go to ur place for some beautiful experience . Cheers. If the owner sees this. The food can be skipped.

But he didn't think its necessary to inform the customer. Then after some time I called, a waiter come I said give her a seven up, he said seven not available, sprite available. Okey bring one. But no response. After five mins he is facing back of our table. Then I called then the first waiter come. Bull shit service, you have luck if family is not with me, I would teach you a lesson.",0
"Had the Biriyani with Chicken yesterday. Over priced and worst food that I have had in my entire life. Heard a lot of good things about this place, but turned out to be such a disappointment. The chicken was not even properly cooked. Price is undoubtedly high in terms of quality of food. Will never visit again",0
"Had great expectation for this place. Went there on Valentines Day. Only thing I enjoyed was their Lebanese themed decoration.Price of the food was overpriced. Furthermore, they served us cold food except Lebanese bread which was the only thing that was hot. Behavior of the staffs were unprofessional. Disappointed ....don't think will visit again.",0
First of all is was too much overpriced for not a single good reason! Totally awful.Worst experience.Guys in a sense they are robber TBH!!! First and LASTTT!!!,0
Highly overpriced items considering the food quality and quantity. Cold vanilla latte was horrible.,0

"I've been here many times. And so far I can recall one day when I wanted the chicken shwarma and it was available. I tried the lamb shish or something similar named yesterday. It was the worst lamb I've ever tried, it was smelly and not cooked properly. I somehow managed to eat a piece or two but then I gave up. Only good thing is the hommous, but if you go there to have an authentic experience, then do yourself a favor and go someplace else.",0
"WORSE KIND OF BIRYANI ,TASTELESS, most of their items are not available . in a word waste of money",0
Taste was below average.. local chicken sharma is far better than the so called Arabian taste sharma.. Totally disappointed,0
"If you want a real taste of Lebanese food AL Amar won't do justice at all, Sorry, I did not find the food comparable to authentic Arabic food",0
Not upto the mark ! The taste was ordinary and the flavours were missing! Not worth the price! Service was good though,0
food wasn't good and the price was too high in context of the amount of food.,0
"It's no match comparing to Kuala Lumpur Service very average, location pretty okay Food average too, still has the opportunity to correct Good luck",0
Food is not like the Malaysian chain...and they are basically for serving lebanese but when we ordered khebsa they said they cannot serve it for some reason...dissapointed,0
Allah will bless Al- Amar Lebanese Cuisine Bangladesh and best of luck,0
"I didn't like the food. Though the environment was good, food was spiceless... Not delicious at all. Food prices were high. Our waiter served our food to a wrong table. We waited for a long time for our food to arrive at our table.",0
Worst food.Portion size was way too small.Even street shawrma is better than their shwarma platter..They charged VAT without VAT number. ..,0
Food quality is horrible we were hospitalized after having the food uncooked meat with hair. Not at all Lebanese quality food.,0
I would like to draw attention of the owner of this restaurant that your staff quality is very poor and they don't know how behave with the customers. Service and commitment level is very poor and even food was not served as per their so called advertisement. Friends think twice to go there.,0
"Went there with wife, thought to pass some quality time with family. Found there was a meeting party going shouting like common dhaka fish market. When we realised the situation we wanted to cancel the order but restaurant forced us to pay but they can not control the environment and make it ok for gentle man. we are pissed off. I don't want to make comment about food as after feeling devastated with the shouting from the unpleasant meeting guys we took parcel and found the food taste like sh*t, even chicken was not properly fried.",0
"Good environment, garbage food. Went there for the first time, had to wait more than 30 minutes just for the soup. They didn't tell during order that it might take that long. But most importantly, soup tasted like just hot spicy water. Didn't bother to try out anything else.",0
"We disappointed for their attitude.Their food quantity and quality, compare to price is too much.Their stuff behaviour is too much rude.",0
Price is too high about their food quality and quantity.Stuff behavior is too much rude.,0
Shitty service ever. They kept me waited for half a hour and told me they can't serve. Total rubbish,0
Very disappointed with their behavior.... we around 50 people booked them for iftar. Took their highest price iftar menu but their food quantity is very poor. They were very unprofessional and rude in behavior. At the time of iftar they forgot to serve one item listed in the menu but we didn't shout just politely informed them. And it took so long to serve the rest item that we already had finished our iftar. After iftar we stayed and we ordered aprox 00 cup of coffeee and paid the bill of that extra coffee but still they were forcing us to leave their restaurant and we were surprised at their such unprofessional attitude. They might not have experience to handle a crowd or any party booking. CAUTION: PLEASE THINK BEFORE ARRANGING ANY GATHERING OR PARTY BOOKING HERE.,0
Absence of manners & hospitality... Even can not maintain menu that was ordered a few days ago... They can not deserve to be visited again...,0
the waiter was so rude. even the manager say louder with customer.,0

"The place is clean and the staff are very friendly , however I believe the management is very stingy. Most of the menus were 6 pieces ( pen corrected from 8.) instead of 8 pieces. The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... reject this ( if there is a licensing authority -unfortunately there is none ) . Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 00). I would spend my money some where else next time.",0

Worst food ever i had. Waste of money and time...,0
Very poor quality food. Highly priced. Went there with colleagues for office party and all of us were disappointed. Absurd 00% service charge. Worst experience.,0
"Horrible experience yesterday.last time it was good,but yesterday they raise price ,also food taste was not good.service people was little bit disturbed.why ???? Don't know. Overall......bad experience....",0
This restaurant is totally disgusting. I ordered Chicken Biriyani Yesterday through FoodPanda. And It was horrible experience for me. Meat Was totally frowsty. This is the second time i face this problem with same restaurant.,0
"Disappointed with the quality of the food. Meatless bones, colored water in the name of fruit juice.",0
"Because, as I am waiting for my cousin in Gulshan 0 for the last one hour, when I called him and finally he picked up after a while and replied, "" ashtesi ashtesi, I'm in front of Tarka for the last one hour""!!!!!!",0
"jafrani polaw, lemon & mint drinks...even 430++ butter chicken bt chicken nai..even tara 05%&5% chrg rakhe bt tader thake chng thakena. pani pure 50/50..kasmiri naan...too much dry..r burn and tandoor dea khawar moton kono salad or sauce e nai. onk baje food quality..",0
"Very much disappointed , even this can be only compared with cheating . ""Tang"" was served in the name of ""Fruit Juice "" .",0
Very bad Service. Every online order they send reek and rotten food. May be two or three days older.,0
"I had their biriyani thrice, hoping to like at least one for once but I hated all of it. The Tandoori and Dosa were really average, like nothing special at all. The drinks and desserts were good though, so was the ambience.",0
So poor ..we order kabab platter....they skip the beaf......,0
Unprofessional service. Not so special food... Didn't find any Indian flavor in the food!!,0
Worst Hyderabadi Biriyani,0
"Tasteless food , less quantity, service wasn't so good, rumali roti seems hard, totally waste of time and money.",0
"Went there with team, worst quality of food with a high price.",0
I did not tyk the way they presented food...kabab were too dry..the forget to serve beaf kabab...overall bad experience,0
Disappointed! Tandoori mixed grill was so salty and Hyderabadi Biryani wasn't actual that.....just they served normal kacchi biryani. But loved the Lime mint juice and plain nun was good.,0
Baaler Service chodao tomra. Unprofessional kichu baal chaal re waiter banaye rakhse. kono manners jane na. Onek din pore review ta dilam. Hope I served it cold. Thanks.,0
According to price food is just worst...& why 00% service charges taken not clear.....but food quality + quantity is simply shocking...,0
"Very poor service and tasteless food, very disappointing in every way possible .",0
Just a Name Tarka....!!! foods are very bad and prices are too damn high....!!,0
"Taste of food like Biryani, Dosa, Tandoori chicken is below average. I dint get any flavour tbh.",0
Worst food with worst taste within extreme prices and some stupid stuff,0
Their service is not up to that mark which it used to be at previous... Food quality is so so..,0
Food quality has detoriated. Who wants to pay 700taka for bitani thali and a glass of coke!,0
Worst food ever i tried..... May be they served yesterday's food. Will never go there..... Dont deserve any rating...,0
Khub baje service.....khaber ses korar age sir Bill ta....ai bole 0ber amer kace ase....ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,0
Tank juice for 000 Taka !!!!!!!! A DIGITAL ROBBERY !!!!,0
Worst of the worst. Quality much deteriorated.,0
Worst sehri. Poor service. Not tasty and too pricy.,0
"Stale food,rubbery naan and watery drinks. Not worth it",0
"Disaster, Highly recommended not to visit.",0
"Food quality was average. Price is unnecessarily high. Service was not good, had to call the waiter several times to place order. They even charge 00% Service charges without even providing much of it. With 05% vat you'll have to pay 05% extra money without getting anything good. It was my 0nd visit and it'll remain the last one. Not going again anytime soon. Not recommended.",0
"Best place for #burnt and #bitter kabab, Soft drinks with out fizz and careless waiters.",0
0 baddho hoia dice 0 thakla 0 ditam ato baja khabar che.......,0
"Mega Platter was a disaster. Before ordering we asked for how many pieces of each type of dish would be in the mix and they assured us it was for 6 (we were 5) but we ended up getting small 4 pieces each which they insisted were large pieces (which is why they are 4...). Complete bullshit and later realized their menu wasn't transparent and didn't mention exactly what would be in the platter. 50% of the platter tasted like old leftovers and the nan's were clearly old and just short of stale. Terrible... We went for dinner and some still assure us their lunch serving is great, but I can't see myself ever heading back. :-(",0
"Overpriced set menu..... contain very few items......we ordered 7 set menus, each of them contained pickles.....but they didn't gv any....we asked for it, then they showed us a very small container containing 3 pieces of pickles which were previously there on the table before our arrival.....anyway, they didn't give any...... outdated decor, food was quite okay though",0
handi is a better option for indian food. quantity is not enough.,0
Totally bullshit & waste of money. Price is also high. Taste isn't good.,0
"total bullshitï¿½ the food quality and service they provide they shouldn't survive in this food business.They take 00% service charge without any service and 05% vat is also there. so 05% extra charge with low quality food and no service at all.soft drinks(sprite,coke) cost 50tk which comes in a tiny glass and those were not imported can obviously -_- hilarious friday experience i would say",0
"I ordered the mix tandoori platter(price 999), but that killed my expectation. I was totally disappointed to taste. There should be chicken leg pieces or breast pieces as tandoori but there was a tiny piece of chicken, fish etcï¿½ï¿½... The beef curry was also as usual, not something very tasty. Overall it was ok with Lucknow biryani, faluda.",0
"I took biriyani thali, biriyani was dry but not bad, overpriced. environment was good, nice place to spend time not crowded. 00% service charge was added though saw only one guy running around.",0
"Worst food, sky high price. Definitely not going anymore..........",0
"I ordered their so called 'chaap thali' where I didn't find any single piece of 'gosh', all I found was some 'jhol' and 3 bones -_- the vegetables were not cooked well! nothing to say actually. -____- totally disappointed.",0
khabar valo but seating arrangement is really poor.,0
Ekdom baj food quality !!!! Iftar e manush k jimmi korey thanda food khawaye ki j business korchhe!! Faltoo..,0
"Well, i had iftar today... and foods were moderate. Didn't taste anything special, besides they were not served by obsequies waiters. Overall experience was quite discontent.",0
not test ..........................................................................................................................................................................,0
Worst food with 00% hidden charge. Waste of time & money,0
The Worst lacchi ever,0
"The first question ""how do people rate sush a kind of restaurant 4 of 5""??!!!! Is it done by the restaurant people or genuinely people have such bad taste with no good food experience at all!!! ( SURPRISINGLY Over-rated ) The food quality is not good.. The platter is not at all worthier may b they brush with burnt burnt and used oil. Butter nan has no butter it dry and when you eat its sandy!! All the appetite will go seeing the glass they use for serving fresh juice.. Juice taste is not good either you can only taste rock salt! Price is too high which derives to disappointment. The only good thing was the Beef Achari that tastes better though beef pieces were supplemented by achar thus the name should be ""Achari Beef"".. No going back again..",0
"I have ordered their Mega platter which was priced at 0900 taka without VAT and Service Charge. I was so embarrassed when it came, most worse platter ever seen in quality and quantity. Had to order other items to subsidise this wrong choice and had spent a fortune. Really unhappy with this.",0
Please never go to this place very disgusting food. Taste yeakkkk. Waste of money and time,0
Visn,0
"First time when i went there food was excellent. But 0nd time, I was surprised to see the food quality. Stale food. You can taste it. We were told those are spice flavor. Ridiculous . We could not eat those food and I asked for a discount and they will give us next time . They really think I will go there next time.",0
They served with burnt Hydrabadi biriyani & it was too much spicy that I couldn't even eat some..,0
Bad service I found a piece of stone in fuska. Bad taste,0
Tasteless food with horrible service.....I am never coming back here...,0
"I was very disappointed with your hyderabadi birayani. I ordered for my nani shashuri and she was really looking forward to having it since I raved so much about this restaurant. I am so embarassed. She tried a spoon and that is it. When I tried it, first thing I tasted was choon, like not kidding. Then the sweetness hit me so hard, I was pretty dumbstruck. I did order dosa as well, which she ate thankfully. But I am sorry to say, hyderabadi biriyani tasted like jorda with mutton pieces. Hope you will look into this matter. Thank you.",0
"As I'm writing this review it's breaking my heart that my favorite restaurant's quality has fallen so much...the other day I ordered 'palak paneer and aloo paratha..n palak paneer was rotten...I informed you about that...n today I m at your place and we face almost same situation. We ordered 0 khichuri thali and one Naan thali and one chicken butter masala. ... 0) khichuri thali: shockingly there was a hair in khichuri! !! My pregnant sis was craving for your khichuri..we or...dered 0 hours before we reach tarka so that we can get the khichuri thali...and that's what she get??? Amazing! There was another time I got hair on my salad but I overlooked it..but today! !! Anyway. ..now the bhortas. ..whenever we ordered khichuri thali we got Taki machher bhorta. .. and today we got tasteless, flooded with mustard oil alu bhorta which we weren't informed before. .when my sis asked the waiter he gave a lame explanation that is 'amra ekekdin ekek bhorta dei' how come we never got any other bhorta!! Lameness er limit thake..if you ran out of food..you could inform us!!and the Kala bhuna...we requested that the last timewe orderedit was so hard that we could hardly eat..n today..it was just same!! UNEXPECTED 0) Naan thali: I ordered garlic Naan..they served plain Naan...when I complain they replaced it with garlic Naan..it it was hard and cold...though they heat it..it was hard...I don't know what happened to tarkas that Naan. ..which used to melt in mouth....everything in the thali was cold. ..daal was more like home made daal chorchori...n palak paneer. ..saltless. ..tasteless. ..it didn't even had the buttery texture it used to have....DISAPPOINTED 3)chicken butter masala : taste was good...but the ratio according to price is very very poor..I tried chicken butter masala before but I had no idea that your restaurant serves it with minced chicken. Anyway...your restaurant was our favorite place..but after having back to back horrible experience. ..my n my family quit...we are never coming back. ..highly dissatisfied and hurt. ..all the best",0
Price low & Food also LOW I hate tarka poor service,0
We had ifter yesterday. Golap jamun was not fresh at all. It tasted like from the previous day. It was cold and tasteless. Please keep a look out,0
"It states that 05% VAT and 7% Service Charge will be added to your bill.# 00% extra.....why not published total price......????? paid total so, why without vat price add",0
We went there before the ramadan and ordered hydrabadi biriyani and it was the worst. It had a very bad smell and when we told the waiters they said it was normal but it wasnt. As far as i know biriyani doesnt have that kind of smell. Handi's one is far better.. -_-,0
Totally worthless place! Overpriced tasteless food.,0
TARKA bonani,0
Fully disappointed...!!!,0
Wastage of money and time.. This review only for set menu.. Which i chosen for lunch..,0
"Worst food i ate ever :/ too much spicy,not tasty,cooking quality is just worst",0
Bad food as well as bad service. I have tested worst Dal Makhni in this place. Can't rate better :(,0
"Went there to celebrate a birthday, the chicken, vegetable, parata and biriyani items were good, however the fish anarkali was disgusting and there was a raw smell of fish coming from it. Could not tolerate the scent and the taste was awful.",0
"Poor service, highly disappointed, waste of money. Seeing so many good reviews I went there today. Ordered biryani thali. It arrived 30mins latter and by the time our lassi was served we were almost done with our food. The biryani was simply cold and the piece of mutton i got was just fat nothing else.",0
Service is poor. Food served in cold condition. Thali is just waste of money. I recommend not to go.,0
The vegetarian dishes were not edible. Though the chats like Dahi Fuchka and Papdi chat were good. Not a place for you if you are looking for a Indian vegetarian food.,0
"Just walked out from your restaurant an will never ever step into your place. Me my mother and Khala come to have lunch every month. But your service turned out to be horrible. We stepped on there at 0:05. Ordered 6 dosa only. Told them that my daughter came Streight from school and we need at least 0 dosa early we waited for an hour. And walked out. In the mean time we saw ( as we sat in from of the kitchen door) a lady in burka , most probably she was one o your staff members and her son walked in to the kitchen. All your staff got busy entertaining her. And while we were walking out they dint bother to stop us. Only good food won't help you to go long way. Sorry.",0

Food is good...!!! but their service is not good n the food is also too expensive n very less quantity....!!!,0
"I came to your place last week.Without a doubt your kababs and curry are very good but your falooda ruined all those.the falooda was too thick only full of thick milk and shabu, jelly and there was nothing to mix..no ice cream or doi. I really think you should work on it.I would not even pay 00tk for such a falooda and you charge 050 tk.",0
Probably one of the worst service level I have seen in Dhaka ...,0
i am being forced to edit the 5 star review to a 0 star depending on my recent visits.. my first visit there was indeed memorable but after that i have went there twice and every time left unsatisfied in terms of food quality and service. not gonna go into details i guess ppl who recently visited can relate very well.,0
"Really bad experience. I ordered a masala dosa and pani puri. My wife ordered a beef roll. The food was taking a while so we decided to order some take away as well while waiting. The first served me the dosa while not serving anything to my wife. The dosa was hard like crystallized caramel! While we started eating the dosa we asked for the remaining orders. After about ten minutes they came back with the pani puri. I finished my meal while my wife was still waiting for her beef roll which arrived even after the take away food was ready. To add to all this misery regarding the service, the food was horrible. Not worth the time, anxiety, or money. Not going back unless the entire serving staff is changed or trained properly. The chefs need some training as well.",0
We had to wait more than one hour for food .. and later we asked for additional salad and they failed to serve that on time . ( Our food was finished by the time they served it) . About the food : ordered hariali kabab with garlic nan. Kabab was good but couldn't find any difference between garlic nan and regular one .,0

"The taste of the pizza was very bad. Although they say the cheese will be more in chicken Supreme pizza, There was no cheese in pizza. Very dirty places.",0
"0. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 0. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 079tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.",0
"Their behaviour was bad, i repeat their ""BEHAVIOUR"" was ""BAD"". We wanted some change as we gave all of our ""khuchra"" tk at the time of order. But they didn't even have the courtesy to say politely that they didn't have any change, it was like we were beggars asking them for money. We ordered both chicken and beef, the amount of chicken was really poor, it was really a fancy cheese version of typical local pizza. So don't get confused by the price.",0
I have waited more than one hour still the food was not ready!,0
"Their pizzas are just average. But behavior is quite extra ordinarily ""POOR"" we ordered 4 pizzas costing about 860. We paid them with 000 taka notes. But later on we wanted to give a 500 taka note instead of those 000 taka notes because it was urgent to have some changes. But, man o man they were like, ""who are you?"" even after explaining the incident the guy who was taking order didn't have the conscience to even say sorry. Frustrated with the behavior!!!!",0

"Fine dining? eh? Very own app? Using some garbage 3rd party app that's not even built for a specific restaurant. Does not work properly. Has so many bugs. And finally, takes 5 minutes to place an order...and then someone has to accept it from Umai...which nobody does. 00 minutes wasted lmao. 05% discount if order through app? But only for one item in cart! Ordered Chicken Karaage. Came without any Soy sauce. Dry af tiny crispy chicken without any taste. Next up Umai Special Creamy Salmon Roll and another Salmon Roll. Big in names; tiny in sizes. Yuuuge in prices. Have had these types of foods in many other places but yours are by far the worse in taste, size but super high on the price. Your 0300tk stuff is worth at most 400tk. I don't mind paying 0.3k or even 0k for a few pieces of rolls. But the food quality has to match, right?",0
"This is very disappointing when you go for unlimited maki offer provided with set menu A, but ended up waiting forever and getting only two maki pieces per person. Either it's a mismanagement or a deception.",0
"We went for the iftar offer, bento box plus unlimited maki. By unlimited I guess they meant two maki pieces per person. We sat for an hour and waited to no avail. The quality of food wasn't that good either.",0
"We went to Umai when it originally opened. It was pretty good. Over time, the quality has reduced tremendously. We just had food delivered at home - extremely poor quality and horribly prepared. Not edible by any standards. A complete and utter waste of money.",0
Tbh I was expecting more from UMAI.. Saw so many good reviews of this place! But in reality the food wasn't good! and the staffs were trained alright! Trained to deceive the customers! Bad Food + Bad Behavior! Also they seemed to behave differently with some guests.,0
"Never thought I'd be THIS disappointed with Umai's food/service. The offer is exceedingly deceiving as it is called 'Bento with ""unlimited"" servings of maki rolls' whereas the restaurant isn't even prepared to serve more than 0/0 maki rolls per person throughout the entire time.",0
Sushi was not fresh. Tastes terrible. Great decor. But you should really focus on the quality and quantity of food. Not going back!,0

They are clearly cheating with their customer in the name of buy 0 get 0 free. I used to love their food but after being there last time I was really shocked. Just to have some crowd and boosting up their sales they started to cheat with customers. If you are truly not capable of offering any kind of promotional activities then dont offer. Dont let your positive customer get a negative impact due to such shameful act.,0
Nice interior bullshit food and dumb stuff..... stuff are almost at the point of arrogant and damn care.... no need to endure this shit when there are loads of other warm welcoming options open in same area.... visited couple of times with hope that last time was a bad day but seems like its getting even worse with time.....like most of bd business once u get recognition ... stop caring about customers,0
Terrible experience. Waited 50 min for food. After that I found the soup was not that what I order ! Service was amazingly bad. Confirm anyone will shocked with the service charge after their service. Just ruin my dinner.,0
They are robber dont go there with bf or gf .. they will took all of your money by system..,0
"The environment was nice. But the bad thing is that, the platter dishes are only available till 7:00 pm. They didn't mention it anywhere, so i was surprised when i wanted to taste them at my dinner. They told me that, they don't get profit from platter dishes...Which i cant believe anyway. The food prices are comparativly very high compare to other restaurants at Dhanmondi.",0
Awful service. Salty. Will never come back.,0
"Nice interior, okay food and extremely dumb stuff. They served the food pretty much in time, but it took them ages to prepare the bill. We almost had to sit the same amount of time waiting for the bill as we did eating.",0
"awful food..I was about to fall sick after taking a sip of their oriental special soup.I ordered a steak and it was equally horrible. The saddest part was their service.After we ordered an apple juice- the waiter took almost 45 minutes to reply me with a very gloomy face that juice is not available. However, some of their kebabs and ambience of the restaurant was good.",0
Food quality is very poor.,0
Never visit this bullshit. They give you the whole menu and when you select a cheaper one...its not available. Only the expensive menus are available.,0

"One of the worst pasta in town, seriously brothers just wasted my 800 bucks. Ordered Chilly cheese fries, a beef cheese burger, Cream chicken pasta and a soup. Everything was so damn sweet!!!!!!!!! They don't know shit about pasta.... the fuck was that??? no cheese, oregano, mushroom!!! just bland powdered milk!!! If you guys don't have a clue why invest in the food industry??? Go for consultancy or shut this fucking restaurant. O stars!! A complete slap in the face!! I will send my pukes in parcel to you guys next thing in the morning!!!! yaaak thuuuu!!!",0
"The burger was dry, over cooked and burned. The worst part was that the burger was served like after an hour. I had a half drank coke my side and the waiter took it away while cleaning without even asking or realizing. They also served two tables that came after us and they even ordered the same burger. Never going back.",0
"Their tagline is ""Big Satisfaction"" seriously ï¿½!!! how they expect satisfaction from a customer after taking one and half hour to serve a ï¿½ . They said huge rush, but it was not more than 05 people... lol Seriously disappointed & never going back there.",0
"Very unprofessional service. This restaurant needs to learn how to manage it's cooks. Ordered a pasta, burger and fries.. After 50 minutes of my order i hear the chef shouting - ""à¦ªà¦¾à¦¸à§à¦¤à¦¾ à¦¬à§Ÿà§‡à¦² à¦•à¦°à¦¸ à¦¨à¦¾à¦‡?"" Then after 5 minutes i asked the cashier,he was still lying about that pasta.. Then i told him - are you gonna give me a refund or should i walk away without a refund.. They did give me a refund after wasting almost an hour but the sad thing is the cashier wasn't sorry or felt any remorse. Was expecting a sorry but his attitude was pretty far from a sorry.. I should've given him the money because he needs it more.. This not how you do business.",0
Service is very bad. I almost waited for 0 hour to just get a burger then again 45 mins to get a seat meal.,0

Havenâ€™t been to a place like this in a long while! Food is not so good. Actual food differs from whatâ€™s on the menu / waiter says while taking booking / order.,0

"Hello. My family as well as myself are very frequent customers at Lucknow. Sad to say, today was by far the worst experience I've had. The orders were placed to be taken away. 0. I've ordered a Beef Bhuna; now from my frequent orders, I know what to expect. It is always served cut in to little cubes. Today I got 0 bones and 0 chunks in the item out of which consisted of fat. This was never the case. 0. I've ordered for Chicken Butter Masala. Once I reached home I came to disc...over that it tastes different. I didn't bother checking the receipt before I left because Lucknow has never failed to reach my expectations, but when I did, it was listed Chicken Tikka Masala. 3. The condiments (salad and dressings) were missing. 4. The Naushijan Vegetable Biriani hardly had any vegetables other than potatoes. Also it was extremely spicy.",0
"Horrible food. Shouldn't have listen to my wife to go there in the first place. We went there at 0:30PM and server told us kitchen will be closed at 3 and we have to order fast with an attitude. Once the food came, presentation was nice but taste was horrible. Definitely won't go there ever again!",0
"As per taste,quality and quantity, price is too high. Also food is not a good taste.",0
At first we asked their service man about something spicy from their menu.They suggest to take Kofta biriyani.Taste was worst.We did not find any evidence of spice there.And I don't know why the hell they are taking service charge?Even they did not serve the platter.None of them ask to serve it as well.But papor was good enough as a starter.Decoration was good enough.But disappointed with food.,0
Not a place for good kebab !,0
All kababs taste are more or less same.So not like the kababs but the kima biriani taste was good.,0
Horrible food! Everything was almost burnt. The waiters behavior wasn't good at all. Everything is overpriced. Think twice before going there,0
Food was tasty n different in taste but staffs weren't friendly and i could say was little rude!,0
Because we asked for Baby chair. But they don't have wow. Stupid management,0
"Disappointed with food taste, service n environment were good though..",0
"Foods were really disgusting ...! Seriously ,,, I will never think of going there second time.",0
not good food.,0
"I tried their handi biriyani. It was way too dry. In addition, the quantity of rice were too much and they only provided one piece of meat. In the same vicinity, you get to have exquisite indian cuisines in Tarka, Dhaba, Handi etc with more economical price and good ambiance. Hopefully Lucknow will keep his rivals in mind and improve their cuisines. I don't mind paying much but it's has to be worthwhile.",0
price is little bit high but most important thing is vat and service charge is about 05% which is very bad.,0
this is the worst pizza I ever had in my life. costly and bad taste...,0

The worst pizza I ever had in my life was their bbq beef pizza. Seriously guys the pizza was made of beef curry. And the bread was raw. When me and my wife nicely asked them one of there stupid staff came to us and we both shocked when that idiot asked us have we ever had pizza? Thanks to my wife that stupid didn't loose any teeth.,0

They took reservation for sehri but when we went there (at 0:05 am) they simply said â€œwe are closedâ€. They didnâ€™t even bother to inform us regarding this cancellation. Most irresponsible restaurant service I have ever experienced. I wish I could rate them â€œzeroâ€ !,0
"The most horrible food i ever had.the mutton torkari was too oily,, piece was small..and the food was not only ordinary bt just totally horrible,i love spice bt it was like the food had no taste ,totally waste of money, Totally Faltu food, rating just 0 out of 00.",0
"I visited few days back. The overall environment and decoration is very pale and sub-standard. The plastic chairs and dirty tables, unhygienic washroom and basin area ruined my taste for having food. Nevertheless, I ordered for their beef and mutton. Simply, taste was rubbish. The mutton was stale and just served after warming the mutton cooked the other day. Anyway, more was left for me. When wished to try their chicken, I was told that it was finished though it was 9 pm only. The brinjal fry was burnt and was not edible at all. The dal was simply as good as that served in a street shop. And finally, the rice was of such poor quality that I can't even imagine even to serve this quality rice to my domestic servant. OK, I tried their firni also and I don't wanna say any more. A total wastage of my money. Determined not to visit ever.",0
Now the rating is like this because I wasn't able to have food here due to their lack of responsibility. I was planning to go to their Bashundhara branch for sehri and for that I did talk to them a few times to ensure they are open for sehri. Now after going there at 0 AM monday night(Tuesday 0am) I found them closed. When asked they replied they ran out of food that day just after the Iftar and that's why they are closed today. Very unprofessional and hugely disappointing. ... Couldn't you post a note saying that in your FB page!!! What the hell is wrong with you guys!!!,0

Totally wasted our money. Burger tasted like shit.. they used very cheap quality bun. Ordered a beef pasta and served me a chicken pasta. Than I had to wait more 30 mins for the beef pasta. Music was good but doesn't make u happy when u r hungry. I am never going back. Now I have lose motion as well.. pathetic,0
"Worst Experience I have ever had. We almost waited for more than 0 hour only for 0 pasta. It was not well cooked. They don't maintain first order first serve basis. Who ordered after us they got their pasta but we didn't. When we asked that waited told us that 'age jeita Ber hoise sheita serve Kora hoise'. I think waiter should know how to provide service. Then they shout to their cook that 'jemon hoise Ber koro'. Every waiter and specially who wear glass should be more professionalism. Personally I won't go think that restaurant to go twice. I would recommend ""Cafe Appeliano"" which is very good in every way.",0
"We ordered 3 chicken pasta and it took almost an hour to serve. The environment was too loud not because of the gathering but the sound tracks they played. I told them 3 times to slow the sound, but they didn't. Pasta was good, but we found so less chicken in that pasta. Amount of pasta was good. The meyeo was good too.",0
Previously I tried your pasta which was one of best one... But yesterday Grind house pasta & Chicken pasta was not up to the mark... We tried Mexican pizza which was good... Plz take care of your pasta items... It should be more cheesy & chicken & beef wasn't there that much. We expect better service from this restaurants... Hope you consider our review... THANKS.,0
Totally disappointed with their lava cake....too much hard to eat ..secondly they mistakenly give another set menu for take way...,0
I ordered tandoori chicken and they served me a very hard and testless type of fried chicken!! And how can I forget the amount of coleslaw!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ very disappointing!!!,0

Um really disappointed when having their food.totally waste of time and money as well.environment is also not up to the standard,0

Yesterday The chicken pasta was the worst pasta ever I ateï¿½ It was 080 tk the chess was so poor all over it was waste of money :\ :\,0

"I hv been there several times.. It was one of my favorite place in Khilgaon. But I must say its quality is deteriorating day by day.. U should keep in mind that the price of food should be adjusted according to the quality of the food, quantity of the food. At first u didnt take VAT. But now u take it. I hv no prblm giving it.. But do u realize the price it becomes?? Does it match with the food?? Today I had iftar there.. I m deeply disappointed with everything. I had Fried R...ice with three items.. It was the worst set meal I hv ever had. If i analyse it briefly i will say Food Quality- 0*, Quantity- 0* , Price-0* (300/-) (Excluding VAT). It becomes 345/- total (Without water, Soft drink) .. I just wanna say I love ur place.. Please adjust the price with the quantity.. And also U should watch out about the quality. Its really horrible.. Dont be blew away so early.. Im one of ur well wisher.. :) :)",0

"After hearing a massive exaggeration about this place, went there for lunch. We wanted to try tacos but they said it's unavailable. Then we asked about nachos but they told us that it can be provided with beef only so finally we ordered Grind House Special Pizza 6 inches and club sandwich! And later...we repented for our decision....the pizza was burnt and tasted too bitter we couldn't even finish half! It was that horrible...and the sandwich was average...you can get that a...t any usual fastfood shop so I had to fill my tummy with two coca colas...moreover the place was too hot.. we asked why they aren't running their air conditioners and they said it's because of load shedding...come on you should take the necessary step to run one ac atleast! They were playing music on high volume so they could have the facility of running atleast one ac during power cut anyways I'm giving one star for their service...it was the only thing I liked about the place...had the wish to taste their Jambola Pasta but after having the pizza I wanted to run as soon as possible...sorry but greatly disappointed after hearing such high reviews OVERHYPED ! ... So... That's my girlfriend's review ... Lol... . xD So I spent 700/- for 0 Coca-Cola & a leftover burnt pizza... OH dear., Thank you.. -_- You are doing great .. Grind House.. Will never ever come again.. :/",0
Food is not so delicious as well as their decorations,0
Really disappointing! Food quantity is really poor compare to price. Everything seems overpriced. Place is nice though.,0
"went there yesterday...jst disappointed...ordered 3 items.chicken pasta was overall . American chopsuey ...looking good bt in taste tht was not American chopsuey..then French fry..was hard, tasteless.and last thing music was playng loudly..tht was uncomfortable..i asked them if they can lower the volume ..bt volume was same then",0

"It is our 5th time at Grand Nawab. We have found that they provide good quantity undoubtedly but the quality of its food are decreasing with the passes of time. Moreover, we are dissatisfied with todays service. My advice to the owners that maintain quality and good service.",0
Only one good thing is the amount of kacci which is completely full fill my tummy. Place vala nah. Kacchir taste o ahamori nah. Badam er sorbot below avg. ... Nganj er public ra sumaiya te kacci Khan. Worthy.,0
"I wish i read the negative reviews before. It is infact overated, maybe it was better in the past but now its not. And the space is very little but the decorations makes up for it? Idk. Friendly enviorment.",0
This is my first time didn't fulfill my expectations at all. The worst biriyani ever but borhani was good. Not like as Kolkata Kacchi Ghor.,0
"The worst biryani I ever eat. Tasteless, only chorbi porda no meat, cold roast and chicken saslik. Maybe they did their own advertising.",0
The most worst kacchi i have in my life. No test on their rice and the piece mutton. Mutton piece are too small. Their behavior was rude with customer.,0
It was tasteless. Basmati rice was too much dry n food is not so quality ful ....,0
"Food was very bad, not a place to go, very bad experience sorry.",0
We had kacchi and borhani with Jafrani sharbat. The kacchi couldnt bear its reputation like we heard before. Borhani was OK. But Jafrani sharbat was Yaak!,0
Worst food of old town. A giant sized potato with attractive packaging that's it Taste 0/00,0
"The kacchi was too much dry,,place was small & the behavior are worst.",0
"It was just unexpected to have Kacchi Biriyani in such a bad condition. Really guys, you need to improve a lot.",0
"went there yesterday. First of all, the way of approach was very disappointing. I planned to order student menu, stated on their page. But the waiter said, These are not available now! I asked him to consult it with his manager. He went and came back within a minute and said, they can, but it will take long time. What a strategy to inhibit us to order those set menus as they are relatively cheap in price! After that, I gave feedback to their manager and he said that, there's... The Fried rice was very good with a good smell. The diameter of the glasses were so less that it could held no more than 050-000 ml of soft drink. The last devastating and irritating thing was, they proposed us at least 5 times to give review on Facebook about their food! Why man? Isn't it my choice that I like to give review or not? Do you people have rights to insist? I felt shame that I brought 0 of my friends there. Like others, you people opened up a restaurant to do business and I appreciate that. But, do that with dignity. I hope you will rectify your mistakes. Wish you a good luck.",0
I wish i hadn't wasted my money! i usually never write these bad reviews but the food and service forced me to write. Total crap. Without decor nothing is even average! Telling you again food and service just awful. And the food was smelling like is has started to rotten!,0
"The Facebook offers seemed quite promising....the interior decor....ambience....is a thumbs up.....bt the 0 persons platter offer we ordered was way below standard.....Thai soup, wanton n fried chicken was ok. ...bt fried rice was nothing even close to average....chicken jhal frezy tasted awful....was just full of onions....all in all....the place is a no no for dining....would not suggest anyone to visit the place....it was just a waste of money n time......",0
3rd class food ever. Offer picture food is not given to me. Amount of the food quantity is low. Also offer price is 598 Taka. So it is a cheap trick to fool us. Food was rotten and it smells bad. Now comes to the service. Their service was extremely bad. Food took 0 hour to receive. Never going there again. Beware everyone don't waste your valuable time and money here.,0

Just picked up a cake smudged on one side. I ordered it 0 days ago. When we received the package we checked it and it was smudged before it was placed into the box. The cake was meant to be for a little girl. Now she isn't pleased at all with her cake. Expected much better. It could have been replaced with one that is not smudged.,0
"Disappointing. Brownies did not taste fresh and of the six different types, each one tasted identical to the next - only the actual toppings (KitKat or Oreo etc) are different, so it's a bit misleading to give them completely different names when they are actually the exact same product. Taste is average. Would not repeat order.",0

Rating 4/00 Service was below poor but they charged 5% serving charge. The man who took our order was talking like a broker in a korbanir hat. Kabab served after a long long time. Taste : Average Price : Too much.,0
They are so irresponsible to serve their customer.And mosty their food are not well cooked.please improve your service,0

"Had dinner with my family. Ordered appetizer platter, 0sopus, seafood salad, jasmine rice and redcurry. The waiter's behaviour was rather defensive and odd.. No customer services whatsoever. Extremely spicy food despite requesting that we have kids. They need to review their chef and staff",0
"The worst Thai food ever! I went there five times to prove myself wrong, but the desi chef consistently served us worst possible food every time. First time I went with a friend and we tried a salad, rice noodle with prawn and finally a coconut ice cream. That was by far the acceptable ones, because we could at least finish eating. We have been fed with the lie that a Thai chef is working in the kitchen, whose big picture is proudly displayed at the entrance! From second time... onwards everything went wrong. Called the manager, who says he is looking into it and never returned. We asked the waiters who also disappeared and never came back. It is the third time we found out that their Thai chef has actually gone on leave two months ago, later found out he left four months ago. The current cook is a Bangladeshi who worked in Bangkok for many years. I am sure he never cooked Thai cuisine for Thai people. Probably worked sat ome desi restaurant in Bangkok cooking desi curries and bhartas! He is your so called â€œThaiâ€ chef currently preparing all the dishes singlehandedly. My God! Last time we went, we ordered a seafood soup in coconut milk and beef Panama curry. The soup was so sweet that we thought we are having coconut milk sherbet! The beef panang curry was also very sweet. My friend and I were so disappointed that we vouched that we will NEVER COME BACK to Absolute Thai. What an absolute cheating! Be aware!",0
"The worst Thai food i have ever had in my life, We order sea food soup, and pad Thai,, Sea food soup was really bad and dont ask about the pad Thai it was horrifying,, Noodels were overcooked, overloaded with sauce, too much sweet, and very raw egg kinda smell.. They told us their chef is from Thailand,... If a Thai chef couldn't cook pad Thai in a right way then who else does!? Maybe that's he couldn't rise up his career in Thailand ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and came to Bangladesh ï¿½ï¿½.. The waste of money but our pictures came out really well,, thats the only good thing about this restaurant.ï¿½ï¿½",0
"Items were far less, not everything mentioned in the Iftar+Dinner buffet menu was there. When you are paying 0k++ for buffet and get only 08+ items to choose from you at least expect the taste to be spot on, but the food didn't taste good. They couldn't even get the fried rice rightï¿½. They claim to be an authentic Thai restaurant but their Pad Thai was the most disappointing dish out of all- It was noodle stirred in a handful of tomato ketchup and eggï¿½. Also, main and desse...rt items were finished by the time we were done with our appetizer and entree. And the most frustrating part of the dinner was the payment. In their facebook post, they mentioned if you pay through certain bank's card you will enjoy 00% discount. So, I decided to pay with my card, which belonged to one of their mentioned banks, but they gave me only 05% discount. When I let them know about their post, they demanded proof-which I showed them on my phone, but still they were firm and rigid on their claim.",0
"The pad thai was basically boiled flat noodle tossed in sauce and scrambled eggs, no bean sprouts or any greens. The mango with sticky rice was horrible with the rice undercooked maybe because the rice was frozen before it was boiled or whatever. Coconut ice cream was ok but too sweet, the only thing good was the tom yam soup but really getting 0 out of 4 dishes taste right is just disappointing.",0
"Itâ€™s been awhile since Iâ€™ve last been here. So, we decided to revisit. And man, how I regret it! The pad thai was so bad and so stinky that we decided to send it back. The only two things that were average was, the fried rice and the red chilli beef. Sea food green curry lacked the flavour and was smelly as well. Fishcake was to rubbery, chicken was basically an overdose of soya sauce. They had only one other table with a family of 5/6 along with us 4, yet my wife literally h...ad to shout â€œexcuse meâ€ to call out the waiter, at least 3/4 times. When I asked about if they had discount for credit cards, the waiter said no with a very straight face till I showed him that EBL signature cards are eligible for 05% discount on ala carte. He went to double check and agreed so. The only thing that probably stood out was they didnâ€™t charge us for the pad thai, which we sent back. Itâ€™s really sad to see a restaurant doing so good when they open and only in a matter of time everything deteriorates. Not going back unless they give me free tickets to Thailand!!!",0
Absolutely pathetic! Worst Thai food I ever had. Quality and taste deteriorated to the lowest level,0
Disappointing food. Ordered 00nd May at 00.00 am; they served 0am. Food was like direct from freezer.,0
"Shocking, We tried earlier it was fabulous, this time with friends of early years tried to enjoy but really felt very much disappointed, other than the fish cake and chicken tempura every dish was below par (even it was cold like local Hotel) and finally the so called noodles had to changed after serving,",0
"Went with a friend for dinner. totally starving after not having had anything to eat the entire day, after shopping. Decided to go for thai food. We arrive around 5ish pm today, there were only 0 tables occupied so of course we expected the service to be fast, but of course that was not the case at all. We ordered thai ice tea, tom yum soup, absolute thai platter, pineapple rice and pad thai. The ice tea too much milk, which ended up really sweet. Tom yum soup was utterly ...disappointing, too much coconut milk. The platter, the only ok, not even good, but ok in it was the fried prawns. The rest was obsolutely rubbish. Pineapple rice was not up to standard at all, the prawn was not fresh at all and the worst of them all which was not even edible and which probably made me and my friend sick was the pad thai, which seemed like it was a left over from yesterday. It had a smell. It was obsolutely rubbish. Worst thai experience i have had. We lost out appetite in the end. We only had a mouthful, paid and left. I felt sick and havent had anything to eat but a chocolate brownie from somewhere else hoping the taste would all be gone and my appetite will get back. But no, my appetite is completely lost. I wouldnt even give this a 0 star! Terrible experience and the service was terrible as well! There were a number of staffs with only 3 tables occupied, including ours however, we had to get up to get the bill as no one came when we called out for anyone! First and last time here. Not worth the time, the food and the money! Dont waste your money! Save the trip! Go somewhere else!",0
"Big disappoinment :( Foods Don't have the wow factor ..just ok While ordered Coconut Ice cream , they served a salty yaak Ice cream and didn't even say sorry while we returned it . Oviously they took the full bill :)",0
I'm not a person who gives bad reviews but I suggest they change their name to Absolute Crap. The can of 7up though was amazing.. washed down the crap taste off my mouth.,0
Absolutely fucking disgusting food!!!! What kind of fucking restaurant did you guys open up to. I literally puked after having the fried rice!!! Ewww disgusting!!!!!!!,0
Poor & Tasteless experience on Iftar.. Served a limited cheap items which are not at all worthful comparing to the price...that's my last to visit there,0
We had high expectations from this restaurant but I was highly disappointed. Absolutely none of the dishes we had were restaurant quality.,0
Beyadop waiters,0
Worst service ever! They took 0 hour to serve the dishes! Food taste below average considering the price.never going back.,0
"Horrible food. Absolutely tasteless. Probably the worst food I have ever tasted. Took beef with black pepper which was too salty. Then the item Thai Noodle with Prawn was just like eating plastic and was tasteless as well. This fried rice was OK. But the dessert item coconut ice was too much salty. And Mango sticky rice - you never ever going to pay for this awful food. When we called the manager and asked whether you have changed your cook or not? With a gentle smile he answered ''The main cook is going to join from 7th Feb'' I will give you some discount SIR since you did not like the food. Wahhh, what an answer!",0
"Horrible service, substandard food, I'm never taking recommendations online ever again. I come in and the waiter asks me ""kar kacche ashcchen?"" What is that? He spills soup while serving and doesn't apologize. He bumps into the table while bringing the main and again doesn't apologize. When I'm billed, I see something in it I didn't even order. Also, the waiters keep hovering around like vultures the whole time as you eat.",0
"Food was good... we ordered Prawn fried rice, seafood thai soup, beef with pepper and sweet and sour king prawns... apart from the rice (which was ordinary at best), everything else was good... Now the problems... the king prawns isn't really cheap, so one would expect equal sized prawns... but the restaurant does the same trick many other restaurants do, they give 0 actual king prawns and the other 0 is less than half the size.... our total for the food was 0000, which (if i...t was all inclusive) would have been perfect and amazing, and I'd have recommended it to my friends and would have visited again....however, the 05% VAT and 00% service charge took our total bill to closely BDT 3000... upon close calculation, we realised that the 3:0 rice which was 575 BDT would actually cost 708 including the ++ .... paying 708 Tk for 3 person rice feels ridiculous for even a 3 michellin star studded restaurant... similarly, water costs 65++ (BDT 80)... we went on a weekend and it was almost empty.... and I can understand why... despite the restaurant being really nice, not a lot of people would go there more than once... I hope the restaurant management realizes that and does something about it, because I'd love to go there again if the price becomes reasonable...",0
"Food was extremely bad, they even charge a 3 year old baby, please don't go there.",0
"The worst restaurant ever! The manager should learn how to behave with customers especially how to behave with a lady. We gave reservation for 00 people but unfortunately 0 of us couldn't show up. They charged for 00 people and when we went to argue the manager told me "" i have never been to any good restaurant so i don't know how it works , all the good fancy restaurants take money for each reservation"" and also said many disrespectful things. Never been this offended in my ...entire life. Restaurant is not about food it is also about the customer service. It seems the authority only wants one time customer, and want their customers to get insulted by their mannerless staffs. Its not about money it is about disrespect. Never going there ever , nor will suggest anyone to go. They need to be sued. RUBBISH PLACE TASTELESS FOOD",0
"It should be called absolute rubbish! We had a booking for 04 persons. Unfortunately 4 people could not come. They said we have to pay for 04 people nevertheless. After negotiation, we had to pay for 00 people! Although the restaurant was half empty. The foods were awful and items were very limited and tasteless. Would never recommend to anyone!",0
"Soup Was Good 8/00, Mixed Fried Rice And Green Curry Was Average 5/00, Environment 7/00",0
"The worst THICK Thai Soup ever! Thoroughly disappointed with the watery consistency and bad texture! -_- If food is priced higher, it needs to taste better! If not, then it should be priced average, just like restaurants in every nook and cranny. Honestly, DISAPPOINTED!",0
"Best statement of the day from you guys. ""Amra berojdar der khawai na"".",0
"I never had such bad Thai food in my life and price was overwhelming. Do not recommend at all. I think the Thai Chef is on leave... Thai food lovers should try ""Thai Emerald"" in Uttara for authentic Thai Food. They are the BEST!",0
Terrible food! Ridiculous presentation. Imbalanced spicy application. Mosquito infestation and absurd front of house performance. Sorry guys but I thought you guys were would do much better.,0
"Absolute Crap. Almost walked out after having an excuse of a fish cake, 'mama piaju' would've fared better. Somehow restrained myself to give the rest of the foods a chance. But alas, none of the foods looked appetising to start with; the rice & noodle were too sweet & the curries were salty. I didn't quite get from which angle this was Thai cuisine apart from some Thai spices & vegetation randomly thrown in. And apparently the chef is Thai. Well, I can imagine he was probably found selling Thai mama piaju on the streets of Thailand. Worst Thai food experience.",0

"Entered Spaghetti Jazz at roughly 0.45pm after calling them up to find out if they were open and where exactly the restaurant was. They asked us to order fast as they we gonna stop the kitchen operations at 3pm. We ordered 0 mushroom steaks. They were quick to serve the food. The grilled vegetables were good. Mashed potato was a little dry. Steak was dry and chewy. Mushrooms tasted bland. The waitress kept on hovering around us and handed the bill over to us not even halfway through the meal. She insisted we pay up the bill then mentioning that they were going to go on a break. At no point were the waiters/wiatresses cordial with us. Their attitude was outright impolite. We should have been notified on arrival that they were going to have a soft-close at 3 and wouldn't be able to serve us then. We would have been alright with that and left. Instead, they served us overcooked steaks and provided us the worst service I've experienced since 0003. To the Management: I am sorry but your steak was overpriced considering the quality and you really need to hire new staff. Alternatively you can also remove the service charge from your prices and make your employees work for the tip, who now get it regardless of how they treat your customers. The two stars I have given you is because of the grilled vegetables and the positive attitude of the guard with the beard; the only good things about our experience at SJ today. This is a very constructive criticism, please take note of it.",0

Food was so bad..service was also poor...plate wasn't clean..,0
The place I visited was really conjusted at the time of vacation. Air conditioning system was not going well. The service here not much pleasant. The food tastes nice as well as the drinks. Overall they are good but they need to improve their service. ï¿½,0
Its not good for buffet at all. One of the Worst Buffet i ever had in my entire life.. heard lot of good reviews about it but it was very bad experience for me. Food was not fresh n tasty. Very poor dessert item bt only their pizza was tasty.,0
Worst management and food taste. Today I went there with my friend's to spent a good time (9.00 pm). So my question is why do you guys have your buffet opened when you can't give the regular buffet items to the customer !!!!,0
"If You want to waste your money in most unhygienic way then you can go there...all those plates were dirty and broken...Worst refills system,there were 7/8 items available and test was disgusting ï¿½.They have no idea how buffet restaurant work. If someone force me to go again there , Iâ€™ll kill him/her and stay in prison forever...Peace ï¿½",0
"Today I with my cousins went there...the experience was really shitty...we called them at 00:30pm & asked about the availability & price of their buffet offer. They informed us about the price & duration would be from 0:30-4:30pm. After going there , they said buffet won't be available for rain ! They will be serving only their usual menu. We asked about the phone call we made previously . They said the guy who received it didn't know about the issue ! Seriously ! This isn't expected from tradition bd. Only good quality food won't serve your business well. Please fill up the communication gap. Previously I recommended many people to go there. But I won't be doing so any more..",0
"I donâ€™t usually write reviews but this was one my most favourites restaurant in mailbag. Also this was one of my most favourite biriyani place. But this is so upsetting. the last day I had it, the biriyani was so dry i had to swallow with water. The food was so cold. The mutton and kebab was smelling gross. And I donâ€™t know what actually happened, their service person was also behaving cold. Overall it was a disgusting experience for me. I brought some office colleagues wi...",0
They did not refill food at buffet. Most of the items are out of stock. Akbar anar por ask korle bole 0 hours lagbe cook korte so sir ajke r ashbe na. Worst service. Place is not hygienic at all. Staffs are not helpful and trained enough. Not recommended.,0
"Worst Buffet i ever had in my entire life.. heard lot of good reviews about it but for me, it was the worst experience of my entire life.. in short ""yaaaaak""..",0
"About two weeks ago I along with some friends visited Tradition BD. but the quality of their food was too poor. we got wholeheartedly disappointed. We didn't find foods freshly cooked at all. Found few ants onto the #Jarda, though after showing that to the waiter the bowl had been changed. Kacchi was like cooked day before & served just to be warmth in microwave!! Really disappointing! -_- Not going to visit that place again!!!! -_-",0
We ordered 0080tk kacchi plate then we realized it was 395tk kacchi plate after seeing the portion...what a fraud..!!!!!,0
Yesterday I went there with my family after 8/9 months to taste their kachi biriyani package.But astonished after tasting their food.The taste and quantity of food's become worsen comparing to the last time I tasted here.Pieces of meat and quantity of rice were much more less.And one more thing behavior of their staffs were so rude and one of them commented harshly literally.Its the responsibility of the owner of tradition bd to give attention to upgrade their service and food quality,0
truely unprofessional home delivery they gave! stupid delivery man! they don't bring the cash receipt! force me to gave him 350/- extra delivery charge for his up & down!! wtf!,0
"Horrible taste of Thai Soup (Tom Yum), I wasted my money on it.",0
This is the second time I been in this restaurant with family. First time it was OK. This time everything was very poor. Service was terrible food wasn't good at all. No one liked it. Some main dish was so tiny it wasn't worth of money. I will never go back again.,0
Very poor service and test less food,0
"I was there tonight with my family. Service was very poor, compared to taste price is too high, and food quantity is very minimum. Staffs were not well mannered. Taste is good today. It is near to my home but I won't go there again.",0
"Visited mirpur Xinxian.Excessive price,but food was below average.price of the soft drinks are too much high.....service was good. Never going there again!",0
Worst service.taste below average. Food Quantity is not satisfying..0:0 would do great for each main dishes.make sure u order more then u r able to eat or else those waiter wud react to ur order like 'matro 3ta item!!! or matro duita item!!!!'.....,0
I was there (03-mar-08) attend a reception program. Taste was poor & service man was very artless ... I am disappoint !,0
"This was my first time here & it was a marrige cereemony. Service was good & food was nice but if u want, u can make the food delecious. Thanks.........",0
Drinks price is so high like 050ml coke price is 50 taka + vat and actual price is 08 taka.l think profit is 0000%.,0
Food quality not good and my kids become sick after eaten.:(,0
Service is poor..My all off relatives who r coming from U.S.A they r not happy about ur service..U should take some steps about ur services.,0
Worst food. Food quality is very low. Service also.,0
"Ordered soft and juicy burger , it isn't worth rating 00/00,9/00 , either overcooked or not much warm (I ordered via pathao food so it could be their fault that they waited too much so it's getting cold) but still I can rate them 6/00 , now come to chocolate cold coffee, I wish I will never drink such tasteless thing, as I was drinking sugar syrup with some ice cube that not even melted 0/00, my third item was french fries for which I can rate their overall 0 star. This came perfectly and taste rate be 8/00. Unexpected much.",0
"Don't know why the taste of soft & juicy burger is decreasing day by day. Now they use less sauce and there is something missing in chicken also. Really missed the previous taste of this burger. After opening the Jatrabari outlet, bashabo is.......!!!",0
"simply waste of money.i tried their burgers several time just because of some of my friends recommended me to give them treat there that's because this is located in my neighborhood, but each time they dissatisfied me ï¿½",0
totally disappointed. offer valid 0hour only.ï¿½,0
"I am really up set ... So tricky and cheated service... Starting on table, they willing to serve potato and crab ,even we asking for Chicken for our kids. At last our kids feeling embarrassed, how more we should asking for our desired items , rather they come again with crab. Simply Cheating with us even I start shouting they don't feel to say sorry....rather they insist us to start main dishes of buffet. They blundered our dinner , where our relatives from USA, Australia stop taking food . We must insist anybody not to go there to spoil their launch / Dinner ... Food is not only a food ...where enjoyment ruined by the tricky cheating business policy.",0
This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever seen. Totally wastage of money and time.,0
recent reviews are not good. the page is born updated. what the fuck happened? is the owner dead or the owner is simply an ignorant who doesn't understand restaurant business!,0
"I been there with my whole family. No welcome drinks. No place for kids. The kabab they offered were too salty and only 3 types. And tasted so bad. Along with it they gave â€œnunâ€ which was so hard that it was hard for us to chew. Then we had the â€œmain course â€œ. None of the food was mouth watering. They didnâ€™t have any sort of mutton, any appetisers with soup. No pasta, no chawmin, beef and prawns were not edible of eating. More over prawns were smelling they werenâ€™t cleaned we...ll. About dessert I didnâ€™t feel like having any of them else than fruits. Anyone who would dine there once wonâ€™t go there again. And someone who loves food should not go there. It would be a loss of money who ever goes there. Please if anyone wants to give charity they give it in the mosque or donate to the beggars donâ€™t go to Absolute B.B.Q and donate the money there.",0
"Every BBQ meat I put in my mouth, it burnt my tongue. Why all the kebabs have to be so spicy? The buffet is a joke; the selection is very poor.",0
Faltu food. Dakat er moto taka ney but fokir er moto food dry. J jabe dhora khaben. Food er test otirikto bajey.,0
Quite disappointed with the food.Not going back again.,0
kebab quality is poor. service stuffs are do not know how to smile. as per charges of buffet food should be good quality. overall services is not satisfactory.,0
"bucz......every food no qualities, no testy every on think this",0
in my table no mutton in bbq. its very unexpected to me. as a whole just wastage of time and money,0
worst approach and food as well..,0
Food quality is very poor not up to the standard and price is very expensive...!!!,0

Worst buffet lunch I ever had yesterday.. Disappointed.. ï¿½,0
least amount of items and poor performance of cooks.,0
Service deteriorated.,0
Number of items need to increase. Food supply is not good. Mutton kabab supply was intentionally poor. Should not taste Biriyani Beef.. its just waste of money. In my opinion it can not be a buffet restaurent.,0
"Just within Two week they shows their real face actually they doing business now because frist time when we visit they served Shrimp BBQ in lunch but after two week when we visit again they didn't served and when I asked very easily they telling lie that they never served Shrimp BBQ in lunch. One more thing those people who serve BBQ they shows they too disturb to serve us more Two or Three time, is it a business policy? I want to say if you guys don't have ability to give proper service then why? Please do what you can, we spend our money to get better service . You guys have excellent and delicious food but with poorest service.",0
"Cold skewered meat, bland food, worst mixed vegetables I've ever had (literally felt like I was chewing on wood chips soaked in gravy), dry pasta, something that they called fish (not sure what kind of fish was that, as a seafood lover and as someone who traveled to distant places for good fish, I felt offended by the fish dish). I'm not sure why people gave it such high ratings. Spent time with a lot of loved ones, that was the highlight of the visit, certainly not the food. Never going there again even if someone paid me to go there.",0
not much food items.. starter was good but there is less food item in main course that's really dissapointing :/,0
"Arrangements were good but service could be better... as we went for a buffet dinner, I found less items as desert.... There could be more main dishes... Truly speaking, I was not impressed....",0
I was never really convinced that EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA was actually a thing. Until I had it myself. Thanks Kabab on 7. Yesterday's chicken chaap is splattered all over my bathroom walls.,0

"Went there with high expectation. The appetiser was okay but the main dishes were pathetic. There was some smell coming out from the steak and didnâ€™t like the flavour at all. Also we complained about it to the manager and he gave us complementary desserts which also tasted smelly. The presentation was good, service was good but sadly the food taste was not up to the mark. It is an expensive food place so it is normal for customer like us to expect that high quality and value for money we are paying. Hope they will improve and give us the chance to say something good in the future!",0
"Worst iftar cum dinner offer ever, went there with high expectations but was seriously disappointed by the food quality and specially the so called â€œsteakâ€. Is that what you call steak? Totally a deceiving place and severely overpriced",0
extremely bad... the meat is low grade and had no flavour... if you're looking for a good steak for dinner just don't go there,0
It was our first visit. Service is very good. But when it comes to food it was utter disappointment. We asked for medium done steak. But it was literally raw with blood. They took it thrice for cooking it again. Price is on the higher side and alternatives are there. Didnâ€™t like the steak that much. You need to improve massively if u want to stay in competition.,0
Never thought steak will be like this.We ordered tenderloin medium rare however they gave us patchy steak which was extremely hard.Never expect this kind of sevice from them.,0
Really Disappointed with the food & mostly the service!it was too late...,0
not impressed with the deco and chair . Steak is average. Parking was a nightmare .,0
Too much disappointing..,0
Total waste,0
"The white cream pasta is too sweet. Feels like a garbage sweet pitha. The burgers are not well formed and french fries are not crispy and hot. The coleslaw was too sweet too. Dont get me wrong, I love sweet but these are not deserts. I recommend not to go here to waste money and time. The sitting arrangements are good by the way. Oh they also have a coupleâ€™s place for make out and stuffs. If you want to try it in case.",0

"Worst service experience I had from a restaurant in my life. They don't even care about their customers I guess. Very disappointed from their service and behaviour. I asked for their eid offer. Trust me the rice they gave us, I never ate such disgusting rice from any other restaurant.",0
"Used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But today, when I visited there 9:40 pm they were lookin like they r watching some alien :3 then the guy who was sitting in cash counter he said now closing time. then he asked what I want to order I asked their 99tk package fried rice with vegetable and fried chicken including drinks.he told the offer is invalid then I order the regular price as he said available all of this.And their service is just awful. I saw a boy coming with ...a plate having rice and a small piece of chicken no salad and no chinese vegetable!!! I wondered when I asked why its like this he said that vegetables are not available. the worst thing is when I told that I bought a guest with me why u guys insulting me.The waiter told me to manage..Waiters don't have slightest concern for customers. They just move around they don't care at all and the person who took the order he was mad about to go home and when looking for him to answer he was not there already left.who was in cash he took full bill and even did not ask me anything.Awfully he asked extra money for drinks.I never imagined take a bite is giving this worst service now a days. I would never like to go there also I will suggest everybody not to go this shit place ever. ï¿½",0

Sub-per sitting arrangement due for Ramadan can be accepted but for ifter rush food quality will be bad is not at all accepted ... 099 TK platter they charged 000 .. 0TK doesn't matter what matters is you people didn't keep your word .. 0-Fried rice was below average . 0-Chicken was tasteless... 3-Got only 0 piece beef and rest was capsicum at the so called beef masala. 4-Vegetable was average.. And juice was blunt tasteless ... Utterly disappointed,0
In the beginning home service was A class. No delivery charge as my home is near by and amount of food was adequate so was the quality. I have been ordering for quite some time now. Recently they have been serving less quantity and they dont even care about making salad and guess what after complaining over phone they started making more mess. Now the quantity is twice lesser than before and time of delivery has gone up twice too! You were so good before!,0
Poor service,0

Takes 55 minutes after reviving order and failed to give the food. When I cancel it - instead of apologizing they behave as if nothing happened. Low grade food quality and bad interior. #boycott #RIP_TAKE_A_BITE ********************* *********** *****,0
nothing to say about there food.price was responsible but food was not up to the make.I'm totally disappointed. by the way picture tulta vula gasi.,0
Unlimited burger is ridiculous Taste is yeaaaaak Such a waste of money,0
Owner is an asshole. His behavior is very bad. Never going there.,0
Everyone should avoid this restaurant. The owner of this restaurant doesn't know how to behave with girls. He and his wife behaved very badly with honorable Sarika Ona Apu.

There service are poor....there's chicken curry was not tested enough....they can't handle guest properly....,0
"Hands down, worst pasta I've ever eaten. I'd go one step further and say It's probably the worst fast food I've eaten ever. Pizzas found in Cha Birir tong with a price tag of 05 taka taste much better than this. I ordered a naga baked pasta. It had 70% rubber, 09.99% oil and 0.00% chicken. Not even a single molecule of cheese. Literally there was nothing that can resemble anything close to cheese. There were in total 3 microscopic pieces of chicken. Taste: 0/00... Price: -inf / 00 ( I was charged 039 taka for this piece of crap. ) I get that it can be hectic before iftar and quality of some items might fall. But what I was delivered, was simply garbage. Unless someone's dying of hunger, s/he dare not touch this abomination.",0
"I went there today for the first time with my friend to try their pasta. Even before we got the food I got so mad and frustrated by the attitude of one of the waiters. I felt like we are getting paid to sit and wait and take their bullshit attitude. I'm sorry but horrible service and place. I'm pretty sure the owner doesn't know about this mismanagement, I hope he does and take some necessary actions against their service and the behaviors of the waiters.",0

"Worst customer service ever,staffs are like Don with some attitudes.Very very disappointed several times with it.Please don't go there.They were not like this before,may be ARROGANCE dragged them here.And about the AC?Lol!Let's not say anything about this SHIT!!!",0
"Well i have have visiting this place a lot for last one year but today they just ruined every interest. Probably i wont be coming here again. First of all AC does not work properly and no fan is there. Secondly management is not strong enough and the rules for entering smoking zone is absurd. The smoking zone was supposed to be off limits till iftar and half an hour before Magrib, some couple rushed inside taking their backs and plates and waiters were just standing still. Thirdly, itâ€™s Ramadan and unlike other restaurants they dont serve their set meals, absolutely weird. And lastly, They served me drinks ï¿½ 5 mins after Magrib Ajaan. -_-",0
"food is okay but the service is horrible! I don't get to pay for a place where I should stand attitude from a waiter! u guys should train ur waiters with proper manner and behavior. moreover, cleanliness is an important part! try to keep ur restaurant clean!",0
"I was a regular customer here along with my friends...and we loved their pasta and service as well. But went today after 4-5months I guess... Worst service ever... The waiters are like Nawab... They don't pay attention, they don't listen... What the hell! ï¿½ï¿½",0
Worst service ever. The place is really dirty. Open toilet. Loud music. Unprofessional waiters. Burnt food. No mannerisms. Only good thing about this place is the pastas are good and price is reasonable. The authority should look into the matter or this place would close soon.,0
The food is moderate but the service of waiters were very bad.They act as if I was eating there for free.So as a self respecting man I won't recommend you going there even if it is the last place on Earth to eat!,0
Ordered Naga Bake Pasta-039/- Regular Bake Pasta- 039/- from Pasta State through Pathao. The taste was fine but quantity was not even enough for one person & they did not even provide their white sauce. :/ It's better to dine in rather than having take away.,0
"worst food, worst service, the waiters dont respond plus dey wont care wat u r saying, didnt get da drinks even after the azan, no sause for pizza, have to eat dat dry, if I could give negative rating,I will surely do that...",0
"Bangladesh has finally struck oil at the bottom of their pasta bowls. No meat, no sauce, no cheese; just boiled pasta drenched with grease.",0
Worst service ever !!! Even the inside environment is not good.. the behaviour of the waiters are worst i have ever seen !! They donâ€™t even know how to say â€œsorryâ€ or â€œnoâ€ if they donâ€™t have any food item available in that time.,0
One of the worst place! The behavior of the waiters were too much annoying! First they gave 0 pieces of tissue in our table! Then when we asked for more they gave us 4! Even they burnt the cheese of the cheesy French fries! We had to call the waiters for 3-4 times then they showed up! Never gonna come here again!,0

Never going to visit the place again. Very dirty and rude behaviour. People avoid the place!,0
worst service.. food quality is good but the place is so much disgusting..,0
"I have odered MeatLover's Pasta & Four seasons pizza (s). This pizza when I tasted before was good but today its horrible. Can't eat a slice due to bad taste & thick crust. When I approached the manager to acknowledge the matter his attitude was too bad. Then we started pasta, it was not tht much good. After a while when I said to give the Garlic sauce, they replied tht its Empty in their stock...So Horrible. Even manager hadn't take any action against it. I am just too fru...strate about this issue of the manager... Please Resolve This issue ASAP for the sake of your own.. THANK YOU",0
"Worst place I had ever gone. Their service is really bad. I ordered food and wait 40 minuets, later i called the waiter and knew they didnâ€™t take our order. They donâ€™t even response how ridiculous.........",0
Service not good. Waiters will make you frustrated. AC not working. Tables are not clean. Wont go there again.,0
Took meat lovers pasta. Worst pasta Iâ€™ve ever tasted!,0

There was a bad smell inside the restaurant. This is the second time I went there and the food taste deteriorated. ACs we're not working. Bad service of waiters.,0
"My suggestion will me, never go for it ï¿½ Worst service ever. This guys are really disgusting. They actually never care about there customer. So why should you go there?? It's totally waste of time. So you shouldn't go there ï¿½ï¿½",0
It was very bad experience to eat pasta in pasta state. Service is very bad. Food is not well cooked & taste is bad also. Even the waiter behaviour like awkward as they don't care about their customers...and so on. Overall bad experience.ðŸ˜¡,0

"Literary they gave rotten pasta. I asked them and their answer was "" may be it is not properly baked ""... After that they changed it. changed one was better. Actually it was their policy to sell rotten food.",0
"Jogghonno food, service, environment... Everyone should avoid this place",0
the prizes were not proportionally made. some of the items were over prized. all of the pastas were same. only 4 baked pasta item. drinks were also over prized. service was not that bad. it has nothing new to introduce or special.,0
I taste there some type of pasta. Taste was good but they add too much oil in there paste... and last time i found an insect in there paste...,0
"Very poor service, waiters are not know how to behave.. Wait for 30 minute for pasta.. Never going there again because of the service.",0
"One of worst place i ve evr been to.... Their service is sick n slow..... Ordered a pasta basta but it was simply burned n cold from inside.... N also ordered coke but dey forgot to serve... Wen asked bfr payin dey said...."" Apnr drinks dei nai"" simply lol..... N worst pasta",0

"Went to Pasta State Dhanmondi to have unlimited Pasta.... I had buffet and Unlimited meals at least 30-40 times in the last few years but this wast the worst unlimited offer.... Here's a short review~ So when I was entering the restaurant a guy was going out , he came back 0 minute after that and complained that a cockroach came out from his Pizza Box ï¿½ I saw the cockroach too.... Kinda lost my appetite there... They probably changed his pizza after that. After that we were w...aiting and the electricity went off, The whole restaurant was for at least 05 minutes so I am guessing they don't have a generator. Finally they served the pastas 00 minutes before Iftar... it was looking good to be honest... So after azan we started eating and the next experience is horrible... There was only cheese top layer... they just mixed mayonnaise with some boiled pasta and topped it with a lil bit of cheese and served it... At least 0/5th part of the bowl was full of oil ï¿½ I ate 00 huges slices of pizza in another restaurant last week so eating 5/6 bowls or atleast 3 bowls of Pasta is nothing for me... My friend didn't even try another bowl... I went for a second one and they said they don't have any more bowls to serve the pastas so they started serving in take away containers.... Btw ALL of the plates and bowls were broken (the edges) I couldn't even finish the second one... so I requested a waiter to pack it up for me so I can give it to someone on the street since it's Ramadan we shouldn't waste food ï¿½ They packed it up.... Almost everyone took their pasta in parcel because they couldn't finish it... (though it was an unlimited offer) They are serving their ""Special Baked Pasta"" only with Coke/Sprite~ Price : 345tk (including everything) Taste : 0/00 ï¿½ Environment : 5/00 Service : 5/00 I won't even recommend my enemy to go and take this order ï¿½ Really disappointed~",0
Very bad in serving... Foods are tasty.. But waiters does not hear properly and very very bad in management I must say.,0
Cheese quality khb baje pizza kivabe ato baje taste hoy I have no idea!on cheese dia manei Khabar valo hoe jabe try to change this idea!,0
The seats are too dirty.I didn't feel like sitting on their chairs ï¿½. The waiters are not trained at all. The food was Good.,0
naga pasta and pasta basta were tasty but there were many small sized cockroaches creeping around our table all through the time..instead of telling the staffs their response was unsatisfactory ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,0
The behavior of the staff was worse Only pasta better all other items not good at all.,0
"Could not eat more than one spoonful of their white sauce pasta... It was horrible, special baked pasta was edible but too oily and undercooked, we just wasted our money",0
"ordered regular baked pasta and set menu 0. pasta was too much oily and the fried chicken was saltless.And wwrost thing was they served in a plate which was broken by side.Beside this, their interior is not good according to me.The good thing was when we said the manager that food was not good he says sorry and didn't take the bill for pasta.",0
Worst and reckless service!! Ordered a pasta and they kept me waiting for over 50 minutes! Called their waiters thrice! For the first tow times they didn't even bothered to answer! I mean seriously! I aint going this shitty place ever again!! And i hope they fail in their business miserably soon!!,0
I went there 3 times.But last time the taste of the food(Regular Bake Pasta) was disgusting.There was lack of cheese and the quantity was not sufficient. Moreover the behave of the waiters was awful.,0
Worst place totally disappointed with the service ï¿½ï¿½,0
The service was pathetic. The waiter hardly responses and the air conditioner was also not working. When we asked about something they took very long. Overall the foods were average. An overrated place !,0
"Had 0 regular bake pasta and 0 white sauce pasta. The test was nothing but average I felt. Expected more from them, so it is unsatisfactory.",0
Food was good but accommodation and service was very bad.I am totally ï¿½ disappointed ï¿½,0

Had horrible experience today. Went there at 3:40pm and it was quite crowded. Ordered 0 beef naga pasta and cheesy french fries at 3:50pm after getting seats. At 4:00 a waiter came by and asked if we ordered. We said yes we did and repeated our order again to him to be sure. We waited till 4:30pm yet no food. And finally with anger and hunger without any food we left the restaurant at 5:00pm. You call this service? Shame on you people!,0
Pasta tastes good.Slow service and we found piece of mirror inside our pasta...after that we got discount but its really risky...for anyone...,0
"So we ordered Special Baked Pasta. For a place that calls themselves 'Pasta State', I have to warn you not to try their Pasta. My pasta was suppose to have beef in it and when I asked about the waiter about this, they told me they ran out of beef (!!) .The pasta was a huge disappointment. It seemed to be made of more soft flour than hard durum wheat, which resulted in pasta that made a flour-like gravy when combined with wet ingredients. AND one more thing, DCC's public toilets are more clean than yours!",0
worst pasta ever.wastage of money.they dont know how to cook pasta.,0

Pizza not as described in the menu. I ordered two different pizzas. Surprisingly both looked and tasted the same. :/ They used the local Dhaka cheese instead of Mozzarella on the crust. Very minimal amount of beef/chicken on the crust. Dough got hard even when it was warm. I needed to heat it twice in the oven to eat. Never ever ordering from them again.,0
"i ordered ""four season pizza"" through food panda but the irony is i did not found any beef,chicken & shrimp as they mentioned in their menu.i only found pepperoni,black olive,mushrooms & cheese.moreover they sent the pizza in the packages that smells damp. But the taste of the pizza is good.",0

Worst restaurant ever in the restaurant history of my life...0 hours passed by but they still couldn't serve 0 pizzas of 00inch...what theee....kichu bllm na just..,0
"Worst service.. They had only three tables to cover.. They somehow managed that to look like a rush.. Took more than one hour to serve simple oven baked pasta which by the way was blunt and creamy. The chicken steak oregano tasted good but the quantity and the price don't match at all. Set menu was average with very unpleasant decoration.. But coming back to my first point, if you guys can't serve anything within a given time please do have the decency to accept it and tell us on the face. People who came late and ordered late got their foods served but others had to wait for no apparent reason ! Customers don't want 00% honour or whatsoever for your lousy service.. Never going back to your place and obviously not recommending it to others.. but then again with so many customers in your grasp a lousy review doesn't matter anyway.",0
"They are not clear on their terms. I asked them to know 05 food menu but they told me that i have to visit their place to know, so just to know menu i have have to go their. Pathetic.",0

"Buffet service is very poor. You are taking 508 tk, but what's the menu??????. All the items are cold except soup which by the way have nothing in it. Along with us people were looking for chicken and beef item. What we found is some beef chilli hardly any beef. Lemon chicken which you were refilling when we are asking. Surprisingly no desert. As a desert served bread with jelly on it (don't know the name). The only good thing was vegetables.",0

Bunker is nice but now a day's their food is getting worse,0
The worst experience I ever had here. The taste of the food is really bad. Their service is not good at all. The worst restaurant in Taltola area. Totally waste of money.,0
This is the worst restaurant in Taltola. I don't know how on earth they dared to serve customers like this way. Their waiters are really manner less. We had to wait for a long time to get the foods served. I don't know how they got 006 Five Star reviews here. I am pretty sure that all of them are owners closest ones. This restaurant should be avoided if you don't your money to get wasted on such tasteless food & rubbish service. Never going there again. :( :( :( ï¿½ ï¿½,0
"During last Saturday, I had Iftar cum dinner buffet at Bunkers. So guys, I am reviewing on the basis of only this; do not relate this with any of their regular platters. I had only tasted what was offered in that buffet menu. THE WORST BUFFET EVER I EXPERIENCED !!!... I am not writing this on anger. I let myself cool down, waited for than two days and were thinking where that went wrong; now reviewing. 0. If a restaurant offers buffet, it should be only buffet. No other regular platter should be offered during that time span. That creates a mess. They were offering buffet with every other regular platters. Hence, there place wasn't well designed and stuffs were not properly trained to handle such mayhem. 0. They offered around 30 items and to refill one dish we had to wait like 00 to 05 minutes; standing in a line. If you don't have enough structural setup and expertise to handle a house full of guests, why you guys offer buffet? 3. There were shortage of food. Usually people have spring roll with soup. They were refilling soup but spring roll was vanished; literally vanish after first round. When I asked, they replied (à¦¶à§‡à¦· à¦¹à§Ÿà§‡ à¦—à§‡à¦¸à§‡ à¦­à¦¾à¦‡à§Ÿà¦¾, à¦¸à¦°à¦¿). What nonsense is that? Do you guys even know what buffet means? 4. And there was an item of chicken covered with sauce (I forgot the name). That was good. I could grab 3 pieces and yet again, never refilled. According to their menu, they should have an item of beef, haven't seen it. A guest from the next table said that they gave a new dish, spicy chicken; I went and an empty plate was there. I complained and probably the store manager said (à¦¸à§à¦¯à¦¾à¦°, à¦¦à¦¿à§Ÿà§‡ à¦¤à§‹ à¦•à§à¦²à¦¾à¦¤à§‡ à¦ªà¦¾à¦°à¦›à¦¿ à¦¨à¦¾, à¦¦à§‡à§Ÿà¦¾à¦° à¦¸à¦¾à¦¥à§‡ à¦¸à¦¾à¦¥à§‡à¦‡ à¦¶à§‡à¦· à¦¹à§Ÿà§‡ à¦¯à¦¾à¦šà§à¦›à§‡). Dear that person, let me apologize for my language, but are you stupid? Do the math. Count the number of ovens you have, number of cooks in there, stuffs you have, estimate your food preparation pace, understand how many guests you can handle and over buffet for 5 less than that number. If you cannot cope up with the pace even once, you should be really really sorry. 5. And, now comes the topic of mighty PIZZA. Pizza wasn't included in the buffet menu they showed me but they were offering it. WORLD'S THINNEST PIZZA, I MUST SAY! :P Everyone must go and have a look; really astonishing. 6. Buffet time was till 9PM and most of the dishes were vanished around 7.45PM. People were starting to leave and around 8PM I left with the worst buffet experience in my life.",0
"Services, food taste and behavoiur are higher level 3rd class.. Don't go there.. Because it's a waste of time and money..",0
poor setup..........................................,0
"The worst possible service one could ever expect. Most of the waiters are illiterate as well as untrained. We ordered some random dishes. All of them came randomly as if we asked them one after another. Last but not the least, over-priced tasteless food.",0
I had Chicken Wings Platter and mint Lemonade here. These were tasty but the service is slow. Pizza is not that much good but there is a scope of improvement. environment is fair. The servers have to be careful when they serve the food.,0
Service is poor .....it was sooo late.. Food was okay,0
the place was too good.but their food was not so tasty.I hope they will improve their food quality.,0

"Arranged a birthday party with 000 guests & experienced a bad hospitality. They had very few waiters,also were not professional, so took too long time to surve & clean the table. Food quality was cold as well as not good compair to their price. Only the possitive thing was, their venue was clean & wide. But got complain from almost every guest about their mismanagement.",0

"Last Friday we planned to dine out and headed to Pizza Hut at Dampara, Chittagong. We ordered for a large size cheesy bite pizza with chicken & other expected toppings, baked chicken pasta, fried button mushroom and cream of chicken soup. We were really shocked to find just a few tiny chunks of chicken as part of the toppings over the so-called pizza. Cream of chicken soup was also nothing special. By pouring little cream on a typical glutinous soup, you can't name it cream o...f chicken soup for your very kind information. Trust me, I had much better baked pasta at Da Signature in Chittagong and Shawarma House in Dhaka. Your baked pasta was awefully gravy when the cheese layer was taken off the top. Are you guys making money in Bangladesh by fooling innocent hard-working people down here? Are you ripping us off by using the brand ""Pizza Hut""?",0
"I order almost 0-3 times a week from Pizza Hut PHD Dhanmondi. I order pizza all the time but unfortunately I ordered the chicken mushroom pasta today which happens to be the worst pasta I ever had. No trace of white sauce, the use of slightly roasted onions was so much that it made me wonder if the main ingredient was pasta or onion. You guys just packed me a box full of garbage! Picture in the comment section!",0
"Pizza hut is a international chain restaurant. But in Bangladesh I donâ€™t think itâ€™s official anymore, because the service, food and environment wasnâ€™t like that what it is used to be 5 years back. Me and my wife went last monday the waiter who took our order was stupid. Soup was cold and they are literally cleaning the sealing even people are eating. Well bla bla bla bla. Transcom company should shut it off.",0
Seeking attention to the higher authority! Just been to baily road branch and the food was aweful. Specifically the topping and cheese were smelly on top of that waiter took my order wrong and over charged me so I complained and they kept me waiting while getting the numbers right. I left a complain feedback but I doubt whether it will reach to the higher authority ever. Disgraceful overall!,0
"Good God! After enjoying meals in Pizza hut across the world all my life, I took my boy out during the school break for a treat. He ordered the ""special"" pizza... which turned out to be nothing remotely like what we're used to. Listen, seriously, I know this is Bangladesh and all and you're trying to cater to the native palate but **you don't have to**... pizza hut is now off our list of places (for me and my wife and my son - hat-trick - perfect) because of this monstrosity they served us. If I wanted a Bengali pizza from an American chain (on home ground), I'd head down to my local Habib Hotel and order their curry and rice. It was hideous. The product development team need to stick up a reminder on their desks, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" Meanwhile, I shall be taking my wallet somewhere where I get a pizza when I order one.",0
"I ordered pizza by Food panda. the worst ever i eat. this is iftre time guys. my family didn't told me anything. they send me two pizza. it was buy 0 get 0 free offer. but there is no cheese (what we expected). bread was too much dry. after the iftar, in night i baked extra slice in oven and what??? it looks same as a ""pauruti"" with some onion :( ...sorry pizza hut. please do something good, because you have good reputation in pizza. :( sorry for poor rating.",0
"To the authority, I have been a dedicated customer of Pizza Hut for more than 5 years. Your pizzas and service has always intrigued me. However, recently I have seen you charge high ""exclusive"" VAT and Tax rates for the products. For example, you are charging VAT and Tax for buying soft drinks from your outlets at high rates (BDT030/- VAT+Appl SD for Cheese Lovers and one Mirinda worth BDT 548/- total). Another case: BDT 004/- VAT+Appl SD for a meal worth BDT 699/- I want to know the reason behind this increase. Regards, A Dedicated Customer of Pizza Hut who is loosing faith in the services of the brand.",0
Please make sure that all yours outlets have the actual real offers. And updated all the offers at the web. And do not make people Harris and at list try to keep your company reputation well. Thanks,0
Today I tried the chicken arrabbiata pasta from your Bashundhara outlet. The pasta was absolutely disgusting! I know it is not right to criticize food this way but the food you served tasted so bad. Such a waste of money. There was no cheese and the pasta was undercooked. No wonder this particular outlet is always empty.,0
"Worst unlimited pizza offer ever. You have to order everytime and wait 05 mins for pizza to come. They serve medium sized 0 pizza everytime, which takes less than 0 mins to finish. This is pure rubbish. Please stay away from this trap. Waste of money.",0
Worst pizza in their BOGO offer. Thickest crust with the thinnest topping. It was totally worthless. After eating it seemed like I bought 0.5k worth of bread n sauce. Go and die pizza hut,0
I went to the Mirpur 0 outlet seeing their latest offer. The guy there said the have run out of the specific pizza. I mean why do you put an offer if you can't serve your customers? Why do you do business in the first place?,0
I simply don't like their pizza. It doesn't have the x factor. It's just usal pizza and the price is not reasonable at all specially compared to the taste.,0
I need a lower star rating to rate this place. When pizza hut came to bangladesh it was simply the place to be. But now its ruined by unprofessional uneducated staff who dont even know how to talk to customers. And the quality of food has degraded drastically. I remember i used to love them so much i went there at least once every 0 weeks. Not anymore.,0
Dear Pizza Hut.!!! I think I had lost my mind .... thats why I went to your outlet and gave my phone number at counter..... Anyway please forgive me & do not ... I repeat do not send me your daily painful promotional massages. Please dont.,0
"I wish I could rate them -0! To. Be honest they don't deserve that! I used to think Pizza Hut is an outstanding food chain but they proved me wrong! Called them nearly 8:35 pm for placing an order , 0st receiver told me to call after 9:00 pm as they can't TAKE order then! Who does that? Anyways, next Time I called, they told me that they can't delivery to Jigatola. Was surprised! I told him that I ordered from my present address before. He said it's impossible to deliver to... my address and hung up! After today's experience I was feeling like showering the Pizza Hut delivery management team with all the galis I know:) On which basis Pizza Hut recruits those bloody idiots who don't even know how to serve their customer? How to talk to them? Never expected this, Pizza Hut can be so damn unprofessional!!!!!!!!!! If you can't deliver to a certain area you must announce that! Never ever going to place an order from them .",0
Worst pizza ever I had today....,0
PHD bashundhara has horrible staff with no regards to basic etiquettes. Please hire better staff.,0
Worst experience ever. I will not buy next time. There was nothing especial in this pizza.,0

"This place WAS amazing for 5-6 years straight till last year. Currently no one knows the actual status of its international franchisee license and clearly they don't care about the quality of food anymore. There used to be a time when this was country's only place for pizza and pasta. As many good competitors have risen up now, you don't have to eat the DRY, RUBBERY pasta, and TASTELESS, generic pizza they serve, not anymore. The well behaved waiters they have is a feeble attempt at justifying the ludicrous food they serve for the high price they charge.",0

The cheese pizza was oiled up and couldn't taste the cheese at all. Though the beef pizza was a bit better. Overall not satisfied at all. ~Gulshan 0 pizza hut~",0
"I would never think again to visit Pizza hut ever in my life again. The worst so called pizza in town. These are not pizza's anymore rather only a bunch of tomatoes, cheese and bulky flabby wheat.",0
"Today i ordered a pizza for take away over the phone at 7.30 pm and they advised it will be ready in 00 minutes,due to the road traffic i reached the restaurant at 8.00 pm and when i asked for the order guess what! The order been canceled as they tried to reach me and the mobile was out of reach,what a great customer experience, i am a regular customer to pizza hut and all my data recorded there,which means i am not doing order as anonymous,and the main reason made me pn fire... that i ordered take away as i was extremely sick and tired and when i complained to the manager he said your order has not been canceled ,then when he checked he founds i am saying the truth!, again i ordered the super supreme which is slandered in all pizza hut restaurant all over the globe and the order on the phone was 800 taka and the new one i found it is 760 and i wasn't told it is different,the overall experience is awful and i really sad that you will turn a loyal and promoter customer into the last person who will think to eat your food and i will pass the message to all my friends too,your all staff need hell of hospitality training Best Regards Diaa",0

"Service was quick enough. But poor ingredients, no cheese at all. I ordered from them before, taste was good. But this time i am totally not satisfied. Waste of money",0
"It took 0 hours and 00 minutes for the pizza to get here . My house is less than 0 km away from this place . Kids were almost asleep by time of delivery . I made two phone calls inquiring about the delivery . The person who answered the phone , Imtiaz I believe ( got the name from the delivery person ) is extremely ill mannered and unprofessional. I don't know why I ordered pizza from this God forsaken place in the first place when I live within walking distance of Pizza Hut and Pizza Inn in sector 3 . And the sauce was too sweet . I reckon it was some type of ketchup . Not ordering from here anymore .",0
A big and super no no. No matter whatever the hell this is this is not a 9 inch pizza. I specifically asked for spicy and salty and Capsicum there is nothing called these things in an order. I ordered at 9:40 P.M and the Order arrived at 00:00 P.M which is fast but however I discover there is nothing called I warm or hot this is cold and tasteless. I used to be a regular of you guys and this kind of her service is just not acceptable. I am really sorry but please give me my money back. This is not the kind of food or service that I paid for.,0
"Can't rate the taste, couldn't taste it yet! '0' hours since I ordered.. mighty delivery hasn't arrived till now!!",0
I orderd 00 inch...but it looks just 8 inch...in fact it is 8 inch...they didn't even use origano or some common ingredients....very poor quality...,0
"I ordered an Italian Deep Dish pizza tonight through HungryNaki. It was supposed to be 00"" but it seemed smaller, but I didnt whip out a scale to measure. There was no Beef ham, Bacon, Pepperoni, Onion or Capsicum. The depth of the bread was not filled, essentially making it a non deep dish pizza. The marinara was salty and the cheese was stringy. It might be the worst pizza I have ever had. Funny thing is the quality wasnt this bad before, they had a pretty amazing deep dish pizza. But what I got tonight, I wouldnt even feed my dog. Pathetic.",0
I didnt like the ambience and their ac didnt work at all it was all warmed up and the damn waiter said it was in 06 degree !!! Actually it was in 05 degree ( with heat mode) along with the spicy pizza !! And the waiter didnt serve me at all ! It was unlimited offer we took but he served me only 0 slices!!! He didnt have the decency to offer me any 3rd slice !! He served all of them in the same table not me! I didnt bother to ask him ! He was an idiot ! The money is not worth it at all I will not recommend anyone to visit you guys again.,0
"Ordered pasta through hungrynaki and it was not baked at all... and 0 weeks ago got wrong order of pasta, its almost like you dont care about home deliveries. Disappointed.",0
"Horrible place to have unlimited pizza! All i found was onions and few bits of chicken in their pizzas, and all their flavours tasted alike. Their wedges were pathetic too. Moreover they took longer time to serve pizzas we had to wait for 3-5 minutes for each servings.",0
Don't like the food and even their ambience.. it's not worth of money.. very slow service.. never go again.,0
horrible experience extremely spicy pizza bad taste waste of money never going again...,0

I live in Khilgaon. I used to go to Rizq most of the time. But now a days it's over all services are not good any more. the behavior of waiters are going bellow average. The food taste is not good like the previous time.,0
"I live in Khilgaon. I used to go to Rizq most of the time. But now a days it's over all services are not good any more. the waiters are not working fast. I have to call them at least 4 times to ask the time of serving the food. I went there with my guest who are from another area. We ordered "" Chicken Sahi Bhoj "" 0 hours before we go there but the funny thing the waiter said us that ""mama salad sesh hoiya gese. arr nai "" then we started eating food.The food taste is not good like the previous time.",0
Quantity is pretty low.I took beef Kala vuna.Belive me only 4 piece for 000 tk.Other guys giving 5star are surely paid.Just check carefully before ordering anything.Very disappointing.,0

Previously they were too good but recently it seems poor. I think they need to redecorate & items should be reviewed & changed as well.,0

Not going there anymore. Food quality was already bad and recently saw in tv how filthy and indifferent you are! Will prevent my know persons from going there too.,0
"Itâ€™s going to be lame ! Just getting simple & ordinarie like any other local buffet restaurant.. this was my 0 of a fav place but I think not anymore! Food quality & tests like So So, environment very much reddish, their behavior like â€œwhat I give, u have to take it otherwise leaveâ€ & thatâ€™s not nice at all.... very, VERY much disappointed ! GET WELL SOON",0
Itâ€™s dusguistingly filthy and poor space. You can see the filths scattered all around. God knows when was the last time they even cleaned the air conditioning units as they were quite dirty. The food was awful. Most of the buffet counters were empty and was not refilled even though we had drawn attention to the manager. The artificial glass water fall is stained with fungus. This was definitely not the place where I used to visit frequently when I used to live in Bangladesh a decade earlier. I will not recommend this place at all.,0
"food quality average, but not good as like as previous. visited today after 0005. service was too poor ! didn't event get any spoon and small plates, they said all plates are washing right now ! service boys are too lazy to serve drinks or anything.. another poor service quality buffet restaurant i've ever visit !",0
The food is bad. The bathrooms/washrooms are yucky! Dear authorities please do something about it!,0
I did not like the taste. There was no wow factor. If you only want to have the common and ordinary taste then go for it. Really for me it was a wastage of time and money.,0
Worst food I've ever had .. You people don't even deserve one star .. tasteless food .. restaurant was full of insects .. if you can't maintain the quality than please close your restaurant..,0
The worst Restaurent and very poor which is not clean and cool. AC is not working as well they are very dirty in environment.,0

There are a lot of item but no one item is tasty to eat. Previously it was better than now.. Became sad...,0
"You are selling unhealthy, rotten foods. No one should visit this restaurant.",0
service was worst...........foods were not tasty at all ..... on the other hand crowd .......uff unbearable.,0
disgusting food i went today for lunch came back with upset stomach and still throwing up like crazy this place needs to shut down,0
Very poor quality & insufficient availability of food. & also sub-standard service. Really disappointed dining over there.,0

"#Loved my time in baton rough! Bt after that my time becoming worse than ever i took anyother buffet in Dhaka ! #Many of us suffered from headache ,abdominal cramp due to food poisoning ! You people provide a great service guys!",0
Quality falling day by day. Set the example of how a high rated restaurant went to low rated. just 0-3 item is good among 000 items. Waste of Money,0
service was worst...........foods were not tasty at all ..... on the other hand crowd .......uff unbearable,0
"Very POOR experience we had on 00st July'07. Had been several times there but food taste gone down, very ordinary hotel can cook better than these. Takes time to refill. Very warm atmosphere (how can you enjoy dinner while u sweat?) Very bad customer service - u have to wait for unlimited time if u ask for something. Some of us waited 00 min for spoon, I had to ask 5 times to serve drinks and got after 05 min when we all done eating!! Manager challenged us at the time of bill... and didnt learn how to deal/talk to customers/guests- we had a guest below 00 years who is supposed to get 50% billed but Manager claims she is around 00 years old. (how mean! -in that case shall we keep birth certificate?) Overall experience is very bad! > Food - 0/5 > Environment - 0/5 > Service - 0/5 (if u cant manage the crowd/customers/food/restaurant, better u close it!)",0
"Just quantity, no quality!!! ..complete disappoinment..!!",0
"Had an Iftar buffet the day before yesterday. To be honest, the quality streak is no where near what we call uniform. The same items referred to as delicious by your peers, would appear below standard at your turn. And the vice versa in case of items praised by you. Towards the end, while almost majority of the guests were gone, I found a waiter busy in picking up the beefbhuna for himself! They weren't replenishing the items otherwise being called for to refill, that too with sloth-like locomotion. Will never visit again for sure.",0
Quality is not that good!! Though buffet and a lot variety is there but they should Maintain the quality & taste as well.,0

aircondition doesn't work. Test is very unexpected and dessert item is much less than expected. Never wanna go there again,0
Yesterday we had lunch over there. There were some other programs going on. They use bamboo with cloth to separate space. Food wasn't upto the mark. Dessert items are less than expected. No air conditions were working. After forth complaints they sent a person to fix it but nothing happened. Most places they set up GFC fans. This place is totally a bullshit. I suggest not to go there..,0
"Foods are disgusting, using GFC fans for cooling the temperature, gilapi and pudding were the only good looking dessert they had!",0
Terrible food....yuck,0
Their customer service isn't good enough...:/,0
Used to be great value for money at the begining but now the quality has gone down.,0
They better stick to the lifestyle section and don't need to increase brand portfolio since they already know how to make it right and consistent.,0
"I used to like visiting this cafe but yesterday's experience has made me determined never to visit the place again. I was there with friends and each time my friends wanted to order something, the waiter countered asking them to order someone else. For example, a friend ordered Thai chicken, and the waiter said to order grilled chicken. Another friend ordered chicken pizza and the waiter said to order seafood pizza. These are just 0 examples. The entire fiasco went for more than 05 minutes. And the waiter wasn't even suggesting alternatives. He was blatantly saying, no try the other one. I was extremely pissed with the service and never going back there again.",0
Had ordered a chicken chowmein...almost choked to death as the meat in the chowmein had bones and one got stuck in my throat...kept coughing forcefully and drank a lot of water which helped the bone slide down...isn't chicken chowmein supposed to be prepared with boneless meat only??,0

"Shittiest place I've ever been. I ordered crab soup. That tasted like ""jhol"" and had crab shell0s in it. My boyfriend ordered pasta that was undercooked. And tasted like they were coated in powder milk. There were handfull of pastas that we could count just by looking. Still couldn't finish it. Service is a joke. Pricing is sky high",0
"Couple of days ago we went there & ordered some food and drink the food was WORST as well serviced very poor.hey have no rule like eye contact. after open.we went and enjoyed the food & service but, now it was change to poor. never go there again.",0
food wasnt good i had chicken and pepper steak chowmen which was more sweet you can cook at home the steak was undercookd if you open a meal restaurant you should make sure the chefs know how to cook those dishes,0
Ordered fish and chips parcel. They were supposed to serve with tartar sauce but that's missing! Weird service yet pricy.,0

there serviced & all Food was poor(FALTO)next tine will not go again...?,0
don't go there . service and food both bad :(,0
good,0
"Our experience was pretty bad. They seemed new. Most of the foods in their menu were unavailable. They even gave excuses like ""our fridges were down, so we can't prepare the milkshakes"". The staffs took order from us 5 times as anything we ordered was unavailable, as they went on asking the chefs I think. Finally we managed to order something. Then they kept us waiting for too long time. They even forgot half of our order. Also we ordered wrapped swarma and they claimed we ordered arabian swarma. This type of hazardous experience we had. Quality and quantity does not meet up to the pricing. Food is very much over priced. Moreover place is cozy and uncomfortable. They were not professional at all. I'd not recommend this place.",0
"Recently we went there, cool ambiance with good food under reasonable price. Nice Welcome Drink and Chatni with the food. We had ordered several items but mostly we liked the Chicken Chaap and Brain fry. The Beef Chaap was good but it was over cooked and the Seekh Kabab needs to improve lot more. Over all we are happy and like to come again!",0
0.5 actually. it wasn't fair increasing the price this much (and also the additional tax with that) after getting the attention. best selling point of yours was the reasonable price. not a wise move mate.,0

"I ordered a 06"" Corleone pizza and according to the current offer going on, I got a 00"" ""so-called"" Margharita pizza free ï¿½. Both the pizzas were cold, dry,rubbery and the taste wasn't good at all. The margharita pizza lacked basil leaves which doesn't make it a margharita pizza. And price wise the Corleone pizza is very over-priced.",0
First review: Better than Pizza Roma ... would have given 5* if the crust were thinner and crunchy ! Revised review: ordered Pizza Salvatone which had few sprinkled strips of steaks unlike the picture shown in the menu. And surprisingly switched homemade tomato sauce to Pran tomato sauce (that's how it tasted)...So the pizza was totally sweet. Not having Pizza La Vita again! Far away from the consistency of Pizza Roma,0
The most rubbery and dry pizza i have ever had. Had to throw away half the pizza. Absolutely pathetic.,0
Most ever worst pizza I have eaten today..yakk...Totally waste of money.,0
"Excellent....I never eat this kind of delicious Pizza (Italian Pizza) in Dhaka before.

"The service was really bad. The waiters were rude. Apparently the platters are limited, so we could only order platter 0. They served with missing ingredients. After calling them a million times, they came and added the missing ingredients. Also, the platter says 3 dates but they provided only 0. Not that it matters, but at least don't mention the quantity if you can't deliver. The vegetable and the Dory fish batter had hair. We were so pissed off and there was no time to change, so we just didn't bother to let them know or anything. The food was mediocre. Nothing exceptional. The service and the hair made the experience worse. Highly disappointed. We are paying for good service and good food. The least they can do is not serve unhygienic food and be nice to us.",0
"though the ambience of the restaurant and the taste of the food was more or less good, but the quatity of food is horribly less according to the price. we were around 4 people and we ordered a mixed seafood platter worth around 500 tk.. each platter almost contained 4/5 pieces of mushroom, 3/4 pieces of small calamari, 0 pieces of shrimp, nd e few pieces of chicken. the platter was hardly even enough for one person. you should look into the matter.",0

"We went at around 0 pm, and a little later the waiter told us the food would be around 00 minutes late. This was supposed to be brunch, so we asked them to serve us some food which would come fast, while we waited for the rest. They told us the prawn dim sum would be served in 5 minutes, but it came 00 minutes later. After an hour and half, around 0:30pm, we still hadn't been served anything else! We told the manager that we'll only take any food which they could serve by 0:30, but they failed to serve us our orders even by then. We paid for the dim sums and left ravenously hungry, with no apologies from the manager. Apparently there was some owner's brunch which caused this unacceptable delay! Worst service ever.",0
"I love Chow's dumplings but the price I pay for includes food n service both. We went for a friend's birthday last month n ordered the lamb from the main course (as I had it before n I liked it). I put a piece in my mouth and found the lamb totally cold. My friend thought that the dish has to be served cold but as I mentioned that I had it before. So, I called the waiter n told him about it. He took away the dish right then and came back with explanation - ""the chef went out ...of the kitchen so the other person in charge prepared the dish and he forgot that he didn't warm it."" We are paying this price to have refrigerated food??? The manager came to say sorry n served us complementary brownie but how can it replace the fact that they serve cold food from the refrigerator. I have never seen the management write a reply to any of the reviewer so I wonder, does it really make any difference to them?",0
horrible....price wasn't justified with the quantity of food..so was the taste ï¿½...and really dissappointed.,0
"I was impressed by the decor but was disappointed soon by the food. Food is overpriced and bland. The quantity of each item was very small compared to its high price.I had better dumplings in Dhaka. The chowmein was chewy, leathery and cold. I didn't find any Cantonese flavour in any dish. Even the iced tea was very bitter. The service was very slow and poor. I didn't expect such poor service and bad food from a high-end restaurant like Chows.",0
"A complete disappointment, most of the food we ordered was left uneaten as it tasted stale and unappetizing , the prawns we ordered tasted mushy and had a funky flavor, as did their whole fried fish and fried rice, not at all what you'd expect from a premium establishment. Do not recommend and definitely won't be coming back.",0
"Was extremely disappointed with the service yesterday. We went there for brunch and waited for nearly 0.5 hours and yet the food was not served. Whenever we inquired about the order, they kept insisting that the food would be out in 00-05 minutes. Eventually we got up and left. The staff needs to be given a training on customer service (try getting a crash course from the staff at Izumi)!",0
"I made a reservation for four at 0:30 pm yesterday. I was there on time, however, my friends had reached a few minutes prior to 3:00 pm. Before they could make themselves comfortable, a waiter insisted that we order at once, since apparently their kitchen closes at 3:00 pm. We did, and waited for 40 minutes (which they asked from us) for our food. Immediately after we finished, our waiter had gotten us the bill before we even asked, and said that they were to have a staff pa...rty- an implication that we leave. The food was good, but not out of the world. Therefore, from such a high-end restaurant, service at-least is well desired from a customer's end. Provided the place would be overcrowded (or even close to being crowded) on the occasion of Pohela Boishakh, I would have understood. I'm afraid that many other reviews well portray how they tend to serve their customers.",0
"We availed the buffet iftar,dinner. But the iftar was set menu and dinner had only 5 items including rice & chowmein moreover the taste was average. I don't know about their regular menu but the buffet was not good.",0
"Serious lack of cordiality comparing to the other places I have visited within last few days.. If u want to have good Chinese food find an alternative restaurant.. Interior is beautiful and a dimsum probably named prawn chicken Sui mai tastes good, the ginger drink was good but such a small amount was given",0
"nothing special.... so so... we went two times but food was not that tasty according to the price...and recent days food served cold in many restaurants, don't know why??",0

I don't know why they have chosen the Ramadan for their plunderage and we are encouraging them by taking the part of that dishonesty !",0
They are most arrogant in attitude... everyone should stop going there until thet beg pardon openly......,0

"Waited an hour and a half for cold food and the waiter was very rude. There were 3 kids with us and he claimed our order was ""poor"" for 9 people. We asked repeatedly for the manager who never came. No discounts or apologies. The table opposite us was so furious with the service they yelled and did not touch their food and left. 5 of us said we would never come back.",0
Horrible service. The server forgot to bring two of our ordered items not once but twice! I was very disappointed.,0
we went to Chow following much hype regarding the food and so forth. Unfortunately turns out as following (0) waiters are very poorly trained regarding assistance during placing order and also hearing out on table preference. (0) food is not of much good/better taste then of recently opened other similar restaurants (3) Waiter's advice on the portions were HORRIBLE Highly discourage visits to Chow not only for the service but also for the taste of food.,0
"Going through your Facebook page, nowhere does it say that you have to make prior reservations. My husband and I went to Chows on Friday night, and we were literally turned out because we had no reservations! I see from one of your reviews that another customer had the same complaint. This level of customer service is unacceptable! As a regular food connoisseur, I'd suggest that you teach your staff customer relations because no amount of glitz and glamour will get you loyal customers if your restaurant has abominable customer service!!!",0
I made a reservation at Chows and went their with my foreign guests. Went I called them to reserve a table they told me that the last order was at 3pm however they will consider my foreign guests and still serve us lunch after hours. When I went there with my guests they literally shut the door on our face and refused us to enter the restaurant. They should have never accepted our reservation if they were unable to serve. They don't have basic human decency. I even told them ...that my Chinese guests would just like to look around even if they cant serve us lunch. Still they shut the door on our faces. How can they be so rude to customers when they will have no business without us. I sincerely advice them to learn how to operate a restaurant and teach their staff basic manners. There are number of Chinese restaurants in Dhaka so don't think that your restaurant is any special.,0

We visited their Dhanmondi branch today during lunch time and then the waiter said that, they are not offering this item. When we asked why, then he arrogantly replied to us he doesn't know why and it is their management decision. We found it very unprofessional because of their attitude towards us as if they don't care and on the otherhand, they are constantly promoting their restaurant in social network. Never going back to this restaurant again!",0
"For the first time, I ordered Iftar Platter from HungryNaki! And I didnâ€™t receive two items that were mentioned in the meal list. There was no chicken wings and no drink along with my parcel. What a waste! Food was average but it was incomplete to have iftar without drinks ï¿½! Should I ask for a refund? ï¿½",0
When u provide food it's your responsibility to provide good food. As we paid for the food. Today rice and noodle came to our uni nsu but i must say it was just a waste of money. It's cold and not spicy at all. Thn while eating I found a piece of broken plate on my food. I have nothing to say..........,0
Not a good place for hangout.Food was not same as mentioned in picture.Food taste average.Very tiny place and need to leave place just after food as they pushing.Price is high comparing to food. Not coming again may be.,0
Tramen tasted like instant broth and spaghetti noodles,0
Why do you come to NSU with all your rotten foods every time..??,0
They are really good but could not handle a simple booking.,0
Food test was too much bad & the service was average.. the place was dirty.....,0
Food was good but their services were bad!! It seems that they were not sure about their offers n that leads to confusion!!,0

"I went to your Banani outlet today.. I had the horrible experience of all. You claim to give buy 0 get 0 free offer which means that the food should be enough for four but it wasn't enough for hardly three. Plus you couldn't even give the dishes mentioned in your chart. If you can't provide the exact thing then you should say that. I was so embarrassed in front of my friends. Plus the beef dish you offer was full of onions and tomatoes, the quantity of beef was too low.",0
Salty salty salty food. Even the green chili sauce was too salty.,0
Not good . taste was worse in rice and noodles I have ever eaten.moreover expensive without reason .,0
"faltu,testless,worse food ever I ate there.they don't deserve even 0 star",0
I had dinner with set-B yesterday. The same menu I tasted few months back. This time food taste was rubbish. I shared the experience with manager and he said old chef has move to their Uttara branch which may cause it! As a compensation they gave me 00% discount but I couldn't do my dinner properly and had to take away all foods.,0
Ambience is totally disgusting !! They should train their waiter more!!,0
"Bogus food, worst quality service with terrible dirty environment. Wasted good amount of money for nothing.",0
"I lv ur food,it was gd enough",0
"We ordered Mee Goreng Noodles, General Tso's Chicken, Chicken dumpling. The mee goreng was good. General tso's chicken was so so. The worst was the chicken dumplings, they smelled so horrible and was hard to chew on and anyone would know they were bad. We ate 0 out of 6 and informed the staffs about this. And then after 5 minutes gave us the same thing again. When we complained again they admitting that the seasoning was probably bad. Worst of all, they billed us for it! What the heck??!! If they keep doing this, they will run out of returning customers very soon.",0
Worst experience ever...never gonna go there again..,0
Had buffet iftar today. Unfortunately... food didn't match with my expectation!,0
the first and only time i'm going there. the food was terrible,0
good ambiance... with.... tasteless food ... so not going again :/ :/,0
Went there for lunch today: Environment is so so. Sitting arrangement as well as sits are not comfortable at all. Don't know who are their target customers. Ordered set menu 0 for four. Food was ok type. But prawn pad thai was the worst. It was crap. The chef/cook has basic problem of cooking process of Pad Thai. He needs trainig. Initially pad thai (rice noodles) was boiled in less amount of water. So it's got sticky. And not stir-fried. In addition amount of fried rice was not good enough for 4 person. Overall rating is 0 out of 5.,0
Shittiest food i ever had...they should offer orsaline free wid every meal :3 never going there,0
utter disappointment....,0
"The most terrible food i've had in a long time. They couldn't get a single dish right. The food was either too salty, or too tangy, or just tasted bad. Never going back.",0
"The food was terrible. The saving grace was that it looked good, but thats all . The stir fried beef in sesame oil had buckets of salt, so much that we had to send it back. The general tso's chicken tasted like bits of chicken in tamarind paste. The service was good considering we were the only two customers in the entire place. And now we know why. Most of the food was inedible, however they didtry to fix the beef dish but the result was just weird tasting sugary over salted beef.",0
"The people of Tokyo Express have turned to thievery these days. It was bad enough that the service has gone to hell and that the food portions have decreased in size, they have also turned to stealing your food. Went there today with the family and there was a lot of food left over so we asked them to pack it for us. Got home and saw that all the left over sushi was not there. They didn't pack it. Packed everything else but the sushi. Really disgusting to think that they either ate it or they were going to serve it to the next customer. Really appalling Tokyo Express.",0
We had a really bad experience today in tokyo express.. we go there at 4/ 4.30 .they said we have to order food now..coz there Break time will be started right now.. that's why we ordered as early as possible.they also surved it quickly.. after finishing our meal.At that time there kitchen was close nd break time was started for the staffs.. so cleard our bill.nd started taking some pictures.when we cleared our bills at that time they just turned off all the lights of the res...taurant... At that time we r taking pictures they told us nothing bt turned off lights ac even also closed the door..just got shocked by their behavior.what kind of bad Manner is this?? I never face this kind of behavior in my entire life..no courtasy atall..we pay a handsome amount to eat there.nd they can't behave like this.. i really feel insulted... I think we will also give negative review for ur staffs mannerless behavior,0
"Worst ever experience of dining out at Tokyo Express in Gulshan! With high expectations I took my daughters to have dinner tonight there.I wish I never had gone there . I have tried almost all of the renowned restaurants in Dhaka but this was a nightmare.The service is horribly bad, food came late beyond one can expect Finally when it came, the main dish we crazed for never arrived. We just waited to see what was happening.It wasn't served till the last! Amazingly when the bi...ll came, we were charged also for the dish we never had. The person serving was most inexperienced, ill mannered & paid no attention to our needs. We don't eat free, we pay a lot of money for eating out. I will also complain to the CAB for such managements! The owners of Tokyo express should be more careful in providing services to their customers . I shall never ever go to this place and would highly recommend everyone to think not twice but many many times before going to this restaurant. I had terrible experience tonight ! Thanks to Tokyo express!!!!!",0
I ordered take away Firstly this afternoon before Juma I try to order 0 classic bento box They said come after 0pm Than we can serve you Only after Juma... I came all the way from Dhanmondi I placed my order again over the phone They confirmed that come in 00mts It will be ready But when I reached and settled my bill Now they ask me to wait for 00 to 05mts This means they are placing my order now I don't understand why they committed the time line And being so regular and loyal to Tokyo Express This service is unbearable Management put ears to the complaint Otherwise you will be history Service and Timing matters ....... You are not the only option in town !!!,0

"Tokyo has been one of my very very few favorite places from the time they started but what i have tasted recently has left me utterly disappointed. Firstly the rice, tokyo's fried rice tasted amazing itself but the rice tastes like ""norom bhaat"" i even found few ""shada bhaat er dola"" did you change the rice or something because the rice tastes plain disgusting now! second, the spicy osaka beef tastes rubbery and seems like the only thing used to cook the beef was soy sauce and nothing else. The nanban doesnt even taste the same. the jumbo prawn tempura was the only saving grace! i really hope the management looks into this! this is extremely disheartening for a loyal customer of yours such as me.",0
Food was not bad.... But after finishing my main course they asked for 30 minutes to deliver my desert after asking 3 to 4 times and I had to cancel the desert...didn't feel good.,0
"To me the overall experience was not that good, specially the ambience of the restaurant is not up to the mark.",0
Overpriced. Quality of the food and the amount did not meet expectation. Would not recommend.,0
Went there on February this year. Absolute shit. Deserves 0 star. The tempura was served cold. The soya sauce was overpowering. The sushi tasted bland and few days old. Horrible. Expected a lot,0
The teriyaki chicken was too salty !,0
Tempura served cold(without salt) Wasabi soyas were overpowering Sushis were also bland,0
They have no idea about the measurement of Salt.. ï¿½,0
"If you are going there, keep your expectations low.",0
"Was expecting a great service; after getting recommendation from quite a few friends. Shortage of Miso soup (really? In a Japanese restaurant? REALLY?) The ramen (not really but let's call it the name it was given by the restaurant) came last even though we asked for it first. Also poor choice in music (over remixed pop; c'mon it's 0007), trying to compensate for it by turning it to a deafening amount of loudness. Poor service overall. It's cold in here. I won't recommend coming here but if you do, bring a jacket or a shawl. MOSQUITOS EVERYWHERE. I MEAN EVERYWHERE. IT TOOK ME 05MINS TO WRITE THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO LOUD I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK !!!!!",0
This is the first time I visited Tokyo Express and I ordered Sumo Wrestler's Ramen and they served me my dish with hair in it. I really don't think they are capable enough to run the restaurant. Anyways I'm never probably gonna visit the restaurant again and I seriously think the restaurant is not qualified enough and their license should be revoked.,0
Worst Food 0ta Star dileo Beshi literally Worst Food!,0
Service was way below par. Waited 0 hours for food. Watched customers whom came after us come and go. Never coming back again and I don't recommend the food either. Poor effort in service and culinary skills...,0
My daughter found a bug in her drink and the establishment only wanted to give me a refund on the drink,0

"took that 00 inch new york cheese pizza with wedges and ice tea offer at tk 0000. Pizza tasted rubbish.Wost pizza that I've ever had. And they said, wedges won't ve available so they served sauted mushrooms. Yuckiest mushrooms that I've ever tasted and the amount could be counted in 0 hand( 8-00 pieces of sauted mushroom) though in the offer picture, It showed a small bowl full of wedges. I'm never going to sbarro baily road or in any branch or sbarro again. Loss of money and disrespectful to my tastebud.",0
"Had worst experience at khilgaon branch today. Pizza crust was damn hard, hardly any cheese. Ice lemon tea had no ice, when asked for ice told that ice is finished. Wedges were 8-9 pieces only and we had to wait for this shitty foods for more than an hour. Waiter forgot what we ordered and around half hour later came to us and asked what we want again! We were much excited, as Sbarro opened new in Khilgaon. But if this the service and food quality, no need for it here.",0
"Worst sehri-outing experience I had till date. Yesterday afternoon, I called up the baily road branch and reserved seats for nine people. The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 0:05 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:07 AM, a mere 00 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 00minutes till the sehri deadline.",0
I went to Gulshan sbbaro thrice where the food was very good and high quality. But for last 4 times I went to Baily road outlet.Extremely unprofessional staff.Donâ€™t even know how to perfectly bake a strombly. Every time itâ€™s raw inside.For a chain shop like this where we are paying a lot and getting undone food this is just not done.Sbbaro was one of my favourite place but for these bad services I donâ€™t think I will ever dine in there.You should do something with your service.,0
"Pizza was disastrous. Too much oily that I had to use tissue paper to soak the oil before eating. So called ""Iced Teas"" came without ice, it wasn't even cold. When asked, they replied that they are out of ice, at least they could use cold water. Who drinks tea that is neither cold nor hot (dumb face smiley). Pizza Hut is way way way better",0
"Went to Sbarro Mohommadpur, ordered 0 staffed crush and 0 super supreme. Both taste horrible. Stuffed crush was shoggy and the super supreme's crust was literally like toast biscuit. Please don't go. Food quality is far far behind than Gulshan branch.",0
"You offered a package Buy one 00"" & get another one for free @ TK 0500, Valid till 30th June, I went & placed the order at 5:30 in the evening on 30th June, the bearer took the order n just after 0/3 min he came & said, Sorry Sir the offer was Valid till 30th afternoon, than my point is why you took the order & most disgusting why did you wrote in your offer that it is valid till 30th June, you guys should have written 30th June till afternoon... This is totally unprofessional & clumsy attitude... Next time better be careful in your words n offers... Very Disgusting",0
"Today me and my family visited your mirpur branch. And I ordered one slice shahi pizza. 0st time waiter said ok. Then one man came and ordered 0 big shahi pizzas. After some time waiter came here and said shahi pizza is not available at now. Then we are ordered another flavor pizza. But why man....???? We are ordered one slice ,,, so it was not valued for your..?? Here waiter though that i didnâ€™t listen nothing. But I listen everything.",0

Decoration of the restaurant was good but the food quality was not up to the mark. Also their service was bit slow.,0
Worst possible customer service. It is a pay first service. After paying the money they took 0hour and 05 minutes to bring the food. Is it a joke? Seriously!! More than one hour?? They take the money first so that the customer can't leave. Worst customer service I have ever seen.,0

"If you are foodie and tried various restaurants, you should find the difference. And i think you should visit uttara branch if you have to waste your money. This is by far worst buffet in Dhaka. There are various budget buffet with common and boring items like flavors, premium club, buffet king, Ratatouille etc. They at least serve better foods. But cafe rio, a big disappointment. They banned me and other customers who comments against their restaurant. They are like autocratic Aladin. They will be cutting everyone's pocket with cheap, rotten foods instead of taking criticisms . This is called 'à¦•à§à¦¤à§à¦¤à¦¾à¦° à¦²à§‡à¦œ à¦•à¦–à¦¨à§‹ à¦¸à§‹à¦œà¦¾ à¦¹à§Ÿà¦¨à¦¾'.

"almost every item sucks except masala chicken and beef onion and the desert items .they charge 500 and doesn't include the promised pizza , shameless hijackers i guess . imo the worst buffet in town , any buffet is better than rio buffet . also worth mentioning they serve spoiled food [e.g. chowmein, chinese vegetable etc]",0

"Worst buffet ever. They should focus on the taste rather than the number of items. Only liked the firni/payesh. All the items were either too salty or had no salt at all! The worst was the pizza. It seemed like it was made of leftover chicken curry with a sea of salt! So disappointed. And please write it BDT 500, it's not 499. Though it may seem nothing to any individual person but you are actually charging 500. So write the exact amount that you are taking because at the end this single 0 adds a lot I guess which you are taking intentionally, it's not a honest marketing strategy.",0

Their food quality is very good. One of the delicious burgers in the town. But their service is very bad. I ordered two burgers along with 0 milk shakes. They served the burgers after 00 min. That was okay. But they didn't serve my ordered milk shakes not even after being passed 00 min inspite of telling them again and again. After requesting again and again they served the milk shakes after 45 min.,0
The patty was not up to the mark. The bun was soggy and oil literally dripped from the burger. Cheese was alright. The taste of the patty was more like gorur rezala rather than a burger patty. For the price that has to be paid its totally not worth it. Disappointed.,0
I will suggest not to waste your money! Bad experience for second time. Chicken patty and bun were almost fridged. I complained instantly but nothing changed. You did the best at your beginning but getting worsen day by day!,0

Yuckiest mushrooms that I've ever tasted and the amount could be counted in 0 hand( 8-00 pieces of sauted mushroom) though in the offer picture, It showed a small bowl full of wedges. I'm never going to sbarro baily road or in any branch or sbarro again. Loss of money and disrespectful to my tastebud.",0
"Had worst experience at khilgaon branch today. Pizza crust was damn hard, hardly any cheese. Ice lemon tea had no ice, when asked for ice told that ice is finished. Wedges were 8-9 pieces only and we had to wait for this shitty foods for more than an hour. Waiter forgot what we ordered and around half hour later came to us and asked what we want again! We were much excited, as Sbarro opened new in Khilgaon. But if this the service and food quality, no need for it here.",0
"Worst sehri-outing experience I had till date. Yesterday afternoon, I called up the baily road branch and reserved seats for nine people. The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 0:05 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:07 AM, a mere 00 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 00minutes till the sehri deadline.",0
I went to Gulshan sbbaro thrice where the food was very good and high quality. But for last 4 times I went to Baily road outlet.Extremely unprofessional staff.Donâ€™t even know how to perfectly bake a strombly. Every time itâ€™s raw inside.For a chain shop like this where we are paying a lot and getting undone food this is just not done.Sbbaro was one of my favourite place but for these bad services I donâ€™t think I will ever dine in there.You should do something with your service.,0
"Pizza was disastrous. Too much oily that I had to use tissue paper to soak the oil before eating. So called ""Iced Teas"" came without ice, it wasn't even cold.

Unlimited pizza offer at sbarro Khilgaon branch is not worth to buy. Waste of money. I don't recommend this offer. But I can't tell about the pizzas outside this offer.,0
Had six slices in the unlimited offer. Yesterday. Great service tbh. But DUDE my tummy is DYING. I was in pain ALL day. What did you make that pizza with!!? It. Still. Hurts. Canâ€™t go back. Im a little traumatized. Get your shit together. My tummy is hurting as I type this.,0
Last night I went to your Dhanmondi outlet at Sehri time. It's very unfortunate to inform you that the staffs of Dhanmondi outlet do not know about the sehri offer you published in Facebook. It would be great if you educate and inform your employees about the offering that's published in your social media page,0

Absolute rubbish. We went to the lalbagh branch. Pizza was not that bad. But they took almost an hour to serve. Service was very bad. I don't know why they hired rude idiots as employees. Please don't come here if you don't want to waste your precious time.,0
"Worst Pizza Ever..... tasteless, totally waste of money!!",0
Pretty sure this is not NY Pizza... Hard and brittle using bread dough. Very disappointed!!!,0
Place: Sbarro Bangladesh (Mohammadpur Branch) I was really happy when you opened up a branch near my home but the service was really disappointing. They took 0 hour to serve 4 slices of pizza. As it was already late I took the pizza slices home and found out the pizza was over baked and it was hard and crispy. You should ensure proper capacity and manpower for serving before opening up branches everywhere.,0
Tried baily road sbarro...eto baje r tasteless hobe expect kori ni.,0
My brother went to the Uttara branch and had to wait (and is still waiting) to be served. It has been more than 0 hour and he canâ€™t leave because the staff has already charged him! I strongly suggest that you train your staff before opening 8 stores together. As this kind of investment backed up by such service is a recipe for disaster.,0
Its way too overpriced ..the food is below average and lacks spice.....even the regular drinks which should be 00 taka is charged 80 taka here...never gonna go there again ..,0

"Heard a lot about Sbarro, but never went there in last 0 years. When I saw the opening post (after the BESTever QR Code campaign and BEST quality Facebook post design), I, along with 3 other friends went to the Asad Avenue Outlet. As it is the soft launching phase, so I am not judging them based on their service. This is all about FOOD QUALITY. The crust was as thick as pillow (à¦¬à¦¾à¦²à¦¿à¦¶). The closest competitor in terms of crust thickness would be Captain's World (which I had ...when Ashraful was our Cricket Captain and always regretted before today). Apart from the crust, the pizza was TASTELESS. Maybe you might think I have too Bangali a taste bud, but I never wrote bad review about any place. Yes, I have never been to NY but I have been to Europe 0 times. I am this furious because I have spent BDT 0550 for 0 KG of plain flour crust. Sorry, I could not take it.",0
Not for food Negative review for making Dhaka city polluted by posters ..too much annoying.,0
Ordered a slice of Chicken Tikka and a Cheese Pizza. However The served crust was way over toasted. It was unimaginably dry and hard. I am sorry to say i went to sbarro with high expectations fuelled by all the reviews i saw. I have to say I was quite disappointed,0
"Drinks were literally not up to the mark. It felt like Water. Out of 7 flavors, 3 flavors should not be beef. For some people there was very little variations of Pizza. And had to wait for each slice initially which really killed the appetite.",0
I waited for half an hour but still no pizza.Shitty service,0
"poor service During unlimited pizza offer , Had to wait approximately 30 minutes for a pizza slice ,very disappointing .",0
"[I did not have Sbarro's food so my review is based on their service only] Earlier today I messaged Sbarro asking if they took any reservations, and they replied saying that they did not in fact take any reservations and that it's on first come first serve basis. Which seemed fine to me. When I went there later on today, it was jam packed with people as expected but what surprised me was when the guard asked me if I had a reserved table or not. And then one of the waiters as...ked me the same thing as well. Lots of people were still going inside because they had reserved their seats and I just stood there surprised that they denied taking reservations earlier today and lo and behold they actually did take reservations. In the end me and my siblings had to dine elsewhere. This kind of confusing service is extremely disappointing, especially coming from Sbarro which is widely lauded to have amazing service. And this was our first time there too. My question is this, if you did take reservations then why deny that fact to a potential customer?",0

Overrated Today was the first and last for sure...,0

"once it was finest pizza maker in Dhaka, but now they are worst. yesterday after tasted their unlimited offer we found all are half baked or salty. couldn't eat. wastage of time and harmful for tastebud",0
We took meat delight and supreme pizza. Crust was so hard. Taste was not up to mark. They took service charge but ac couldnt give full coverage. I didnt like their service as well. Wont go there again.,0
The crust was very hard... I felt like eating toast biscuits...,0
"One slice pizza, one roll and a pepsi costed 900tk for lunch. I don't know how mich profit they are making. Their test is falling day by day. the cheese was very very less, meat was very less inside the roll. only flour is real. :) anyways, take care of the cost and price issue. people don't spend 900tk to eat tasteless roll and pizza. good luck",0
Might go if someone gives a treat.. other than that never again ï¿½ #taste_none #salt_none #expensive_yes,0
The quality of pizza has deteriorated. Needles to say their square shaped Roman pizza is beyond horrible.,0
Wost pizza ever...their taste and quality has drastically fall...their so called signature pizza( Sausage & Pepperoni) was below average...and sicilian crust chicken supreme was horrible...there was no sign of meat on the pizza and the crust was way hard...and more over for their horrible service I had to may them...I need to call them min of 5 times for getting service for each time....So think before paying a visit there.. NB: It was one of the best pizza place ever...,0
Waste of money.,0
"They make the strongest crusts in town. I mean you can literally hurt people with the slices of pizzas, they are so hard!!! The layer of cheese is so thin that it can easily beat Megan Fox's hip. On the positive side, The slices were colder than their AC for sure. Chilling experience in a hot weather!!! You can also eat the slices upside down. ... Don't worry, the toppings are glued, so they won't fall off. What a trick to impress your girlfriend!!! Ofcourse, if you have one. A slice of cold, hard, ruti with little less harder toppings. Even the garlic mushroom had too much garlic!!! Pepsi was literally the best thing on your menu!!! On a serious note, if you are charging 000+vat for a slice, i expect quality!!! You are branding pizzas and serving absolute disappointment.",0

Average pizza but they gave us the wrong take out pack and we only saw it when we got home. Very unprofessional.,0
Presentation is awesome BUT food is so so. Pizza not being instantly cooked so not very soft and cheesy. Too much bread. Too much of a good presentation covering up the quality of food,0
Worst Management. Fired a waiter without where the management is clearly responsible for the fault. Provide food after a long time ( about two and half hours) of the placement of the order. Need proper professionalism in the top level management. They used to behave like illiterate and arrogant. Will not visit this place again.,0

Unlimited pizza offer rated 599/- net in their advertisement. But when they gave us bill claimed 05% vat (around 080 tk) in regular voucher. I protested why they included vat but they did not give me any answers. Please protest the illegal activities loudly so that others can aware about their misdeeds & ill intention....,0
"Last week I went to cherry drops to avail the offer ""buy 0 pizza and get 0 pasta free"". When I went inside they said the pizza prices are not the regular price they gave me an increased price than regular menu which was 0000tk and it clearly said VAT included and then when I ordered they said VAT will be added. Without any argument, I had to leave the restaurant because I didn't want to eat from a restaurant who spreads false advertisement to get customers inside their restaurant. No wonder their rating fell below 4. Keep celebrating 4 years with false advertisement and wasting peoples time.",0
"A lot of expectation from their recent offer (buy 0 pizza and get 0 pasta free) but I am sorry to said their four seasons Pizza (00"") and Pasta (same type, though ordered was two different types) was not delicious at all.

"The Blissful BBQ Bash of m cafe costing 300 TK. The presentation of the food was good but they can improve it,well the taste of the food was not up to the mark.The rice tastes good but the quantity of it needs to be increased,the salad that they gave I think it should be sliced more thickly then it would have been better. On the other hand the BBQ ckicken was perfect, according to me it was perfectly cooked, in each an every bite the juicy flavoured of the chicken could be felt ,the BBQ sauce was a perfect combination with it.So over all it was not up to the mark of the pricing stratagy,the pricing should be around 030-050 TK. I know that a cafe have some overhead costs but still charging 300 TK on it, makes the food expensive comparing to the taste and quantity.",0

We showed it to the waiter n latter the chef confirmed that it has gone bad. They offered us another but by that time we were done! The manager was present but he didn't say anything!

total disappointment!!! hated it. this is an example you should not go to a place by just seeing it's review on foodbank. terrible food.. bad music (not live) n interior seat arrangements could have been done considering the view. the waiters are very very unprofessional.one bad experience!!!,0

I'm not going there anymore!",0
Worst pasta I ever had,0
I expect much more from this restaurant and planning to go there but my todayâ€™s experience really not satisfactory: a) Thai soup was not upto the mark full of sauce and prawn was tiny. b) Tried one set menu but sorry to say it disappoint me only fried rice was ok apart from that there was 0 tiny pcs of chicken which they mentioned as chicken fry ï¿½ and 0 pcs fried smelly prawn c) Take away Special Chinese mixed vegetable and which is below average only found the flavour of testing salt. I hope you will improve your food quality. Best of luck,0
We had thai soup where in first serve I had search for prwan chicken Mushroom . So interms of quantity it was not ok. Cashew nut salad quantity was also not enough. Taste of special fried rice;beef sizling;prawn fries were not up to the mark. Overall Food taste below average but price is high. Decoration is good. Environment is fine. Service is bit lazy and unprofessional but they are willing to do better. May be guidance or training can help them. I will not go there 0nd time.,0

But to my dismay, veggies was on my plate. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ But eventhough I'm pissed, I had to finish my ""first"" meal for the day. And the chicken didn't even tasted the same. Thank you for ruining it though. Now, will hunt for another worthy restaurant.",0
Whole fish was over fried. I could not even have it properly. Moreover the staff behaviour was too rude towards me and my husband. Sushi was not at all tasty. I'm never going to visit this place again.,0

food was not fresh and smelled bad.. the chicken fry was over cooked. we were 7 friends and had a very bad food experience. I will never ever go to this cafe. waste of money.,0
"Yes I hated it..I ordered rice with chicken bbq with oreo milkshake..both were disaster!! definitely want to meet with their chef..the rice was undercooked,bbq was burnt,and the oreo was full of ice! the most funny part was after telling them ur oreo is too thick for ice then again take it to blend it once more and serve that again!! only plus point is their decoration only...otherwise ther deserve minus star!!",0
Wedges and onion rings are horrible. The wedges are big in size but has no taste at all. Never buy wedges and onion rings.,0

The pasta wasnt cooked properly. And the huge pieces of tomatoes n onion made it worse than ever. Being a pasta lover I have tried pasta in many places bt had a bad experience here. The pizza was average. The place wasn't that clean especially the cushion covers. Considering everything..had a bad experience there.,0
Trust me.!!! This is the worst place ..The food is just disgusting. I ordered hanging chicken with pasta. I don't even know that it was a chicken or something else..It was just disgusting and horrible. They gave me white sauce but believe me it was like toothpaste. And it's taste was so bad that I can't even explain :(,0
"They should train their employees how to control crowd. They don't even know how to talk n manage customers. A waiter told us to wait for a table.

"We 5 friends tried The latest offer of Buy 0 get 0 free, we also wanted to order other items. But they only had the â€œThai fried rice with chicken fry oneâ€, nothing else. First of all they wanted to amuse their customers by providing free food. But in that case it must be tasty or according to their description. Unfortunately it had a blunder taste. The fried chicken size was 0/3 of the given picture ones. The sizzling had hardly any chicken but full of carrots. Imagine caram... They took order of 5 cold drinks but served 4, when we asked the reason they said they ran out of cold drinks. Even they didnâ€™t have mineral water as well. Later on request they brought us a 500 ml bottle from downstairs. Now tell me in what kind of restaurants they ran out of drinking water??? It was a mistake of going after in such offers. Just thought they earlier provided good food so can give it a try. But sorry never again. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0
"The service was so bad I can't imagine, how come they keep an offer while their microwave oven ain't working. lol it's offensive to hear but we all pay to eat right?? We'll always want the best. How come a restaurant like Cafe theatre have a single oven? If they don't have a single oven they could prepare our pizzas on the others right?? But as they had one and it wasn't working so they couldn't provide us with Pizzas!! lol I'm laughing my ass off and I'm angry like an active volcano in the same time as I've paid for the foods we had and we couldn't have what we wanted. The place is nice but their service us very poor. I think it was our bad omen that we went their to celebrate our birthday program. I won't ever go there and will tell friends too no to go there as well",0

Never going thr again... A simple bread and they named it Chicken lover pizza where no cheese available and chicken tastes so bad,0
After having their buy one get one pasta offer i was like - seriously? Is this what they serve in the name of pasta? Simply their pasta was a complete disaster. There was no chicken slices or other ingredients. The most amazing thing is i found a hair when i was about to complete half of the bowl. Then they replaced it with another one. In this time i was even little bit more surprized because there was no chicken or cheese. Is it awesome? Thanks to cafe theatre ofr giving me the opporunity to feel the taste of a worst pasta.definately not gonna come there eveer. Thumbs up :),0
usually their pastas are quite tasty and spicy n baked good but last time went on their offer buy one and get one free and they gave us pasta with very low quantity and they were not baked in a good way and i didnt find any chicken or beef ...,0
Third Class cafe...please don't waste your money by going there. Poor food quality and price in terms of quality and quantity very high.,0
"Taste of fried rice was good but quantity was very poor.. fried chicken, sweet sour chicken, the vegetable taste was good but side salad was very bad; The worst part was waiters behave. We just finished our lunch, and within a second he started to clean the table. His Behave seemed that he was telling us to just pay the bill and get out. It is a normal manner that when someone finishes his lunch he should have some moment to relax and after that present the bill in front of them. You should definitely teach some manner to your waiters or else you will lose your customers. >:(",0

"I have always been a big fan of North End, but had a terrible experience today. Well, the coffee was very good as usual but the desperate effort of the staffs to close at 00 pm felt a bit weird and extremely uncomfortable. I went to North End at Cityscape tower with my Wife and Brother in law at around 00:30 pm. By that time they have already rounded up all the chairs and tables, which itself is not right if the official closing time is 00 pm. We ordered 4 cappuccino and were... waiting for our Sister to arrive.When she arrived at 00:00 pm they had already closed the sliding door. One of the staffs stopped her outside when she said my coffee has been ordered and they are waiting inside, which can be seen through the glass. The staffs kept arguing with her and given that the sliding door has already been turned off she got hurt hitting the glass door. This is sad as you feel unwelcome in a reputed coffee boutique. I personally feel this is what happens when you leave everything on the staffs. Quite a bad experience!",0

Liked the food bt totally unsatisfied with the environment & their service.. and worst sitting arrangements ever too uncomforble,0
Food was good ... bt didn't like thr environment n mngmnt ... Worst sitting arrangement .. very uncomfortable .. and most imp waiters should learn how to talk with customers ...,0
Food was good. But the management was awfully bad. Waiters should learn how to deal many customers at a time besides they should be well behaved too. Sitting arrangement was very congested & uncomfortable.,0
"The food was quite good. But service was awful....or should I say frustratingly disturbing. The sitting arrangement was too uncomfortable, even though we booked for about 30 people about five days earlier. The waiters have almost zero manners. They don't even like to apologize for their own mistakes! Instead they shove it upon the customers! There should be a NEGATIVE STAR rating system for this restaurant! >:(",0
pasta is not that good compared to some other present in taltola... noodles was better....amount of cheese was less.,0

"This review regarding the home delivery service in Dhanmondi. I placed my order around 8:45pm and got it delivered at 00:40pm. They took around 0 hours to deliver the food! I kept calling the hotline but nobody picked up the call for 03 minutes. The worst part is that this was the third time I faced an issue like this. They always give the excuse that their delivery man is facing problems. If Pizza Inn don't have adequate delivery personnel then stop providing the home delivery service! I am never ordering through Pizza Inn home delivery service ever again! Anyone who is reading this review if you are thinking of ordering pizza for home delivery in Dhanmondi, just don't do it! Majority of the time you'll end up with extreme disappointment and cold pizza...",0
"Very bad service. Took a king khan offer and seated at the end of the row. As a result did not get pizza or drinks refill. Waiters served those who seated in the front row first and if pizza available than served me. I have repeatedly notified them that I am not getting any refill but nothing changed. Then just left the restaurant without having food with disgust. Just a disgusting experience. Hey Pizza Inn, if you cannot comply what you offer than do not do this mal-practice. End of the day service makes the difference.",0
Horrible Ramadan offer.I really liked their regular pizza.But the pizza in Ramadan offer tastes horrible.It was just a thick slice of bread with very less toppings.It was not edible.Complete waste of money.The customer service in banani was also poor.,0
"Your delivery system is very much disgusting. I m trying to order in two place from Gulshan0( near agora) to deliver Minto Road( besides Baridhara), they said, your banani brance can deliver there, when i came banani 00 srore, they said Gulshan can deliver there. Hou funny...pls share your page about stop home delivery ..",0
Ordered the bbq chicken and the meaty max for home delivery. Worst pizza Iâ€™ve ever had! The pizzas were cold and the crusts(thin) were dry and seemed stale. Never ordering from pizza inn againï¿½,0
I visited their bailey road outlet few days ago with my 0 friends . we tried buy one get one free pizza offer! They said the large size was only 305 so we ordered that ! We also ordered 3 drinks (70x3=000) . then the bill was 0050 ! Where the price should be 505 taka . they said the remain amount is for vat . but how could be the vat is so high . worst thing for students! Pizzas also were worst at taste .,0
Normally i like ur regular pizza. But its deceiving when u r giving ramadan unlimited pizza offer. Its completely full of bread with least amount of toppings which tastes horrible. Some of the waiter was very slow. Complete waste of 899tk. Stop betraying ur customer.,0

Worst pizza in town..this is most disgusting pizza i have ever tasted in my life...the topping was maybe 0mm thick?,0
"So I have been a customer of Pizza Inn since it started in Dhaka with their own building in Gulshan,Dhaka. I really liked eating pizza here. But what yesterday happened what just really disappointing. Look people make mistakes. I know that. I saw mistakes in Pizzas since day one. But you people improved. Then you reached the top of pizza chain (atleast to me). But yesterday's service just dragged you down to the last. So like any other day, I went with my family to eat ...pizza around 7 p.m. I sat at my usual place in second floor. Then there was this offer going on where you buy 0 large pizza and get another one absolutely free. So i ordered this BBQ Chicken classic pizza with the another one Pizza Inn Special which costed more. So obviously they took the second one as my order and the first one as the free one. It took them about 00 mins which is usual. They first gave the pizza inn special pizza. No fork or knives were in the table. They never offered one too. Then after I asked, they gave them. The waiter also had lack of knowledge about service (It was not his fault btw because he wasn't trained well. And i even tipped him well because he was really young) Then there came my usual and most favourite flavour BBQ. But it was really disappointing when i tasted the second one (BBQ). It tasted exactly like the first was. It was extremely disappointing to eat two pizzas with the same flavour even i ordered two different ones. I asked the waiter about that but he said he didn't know. I hope you review you your mistakes because I myself never expected this kind of service. My family also got disappointed which made me feel sad because I was the one to force them to eat here whilst they wanted to eat elsewhere....",0
"taste less pizza. bole kina thin crust, bt actually thick crustï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0
Pizza taste was very poor n less chess only bread taste coming so next time i won't come....Plz increase ur ingredients coz we r paying for it....,0
Just hate those pizza.,0
We were very hungry but had to wait too long to get their pizza at uttara branch. Much longer waiting than expected. Must improve service.,0
"worst Pizza I ever had, They shoud remove the most loveable word PIZZA from their name and put something else.",0
"A story of disappointment and deception -_- Poorest food, price and service I have ever experienced! I am totally shocked at your response to the queries of the customers. It took about 40 minutes to deliver pizzas. Almost all the items are overpriced. The pasta I ordered was not worth 475 taka at all. Also, it was almost chilled, didn't look like you cooked it after I ordered. The waiter was always confused to our questions. You put the different columns for pizzas and crusts, well fine. But why there were no thin crusts which we ordered? Your worthless waiter was insisting us to order the high priced ones! That's how the pizza wich was shown taka 660 or something turned into 990 taka! Cunning policy, indeed. Totally disappointed at your work. Never coming again.",0
"First of all they are not worthy enough to give even one star but since this is the minimum rating, I am giving one. Their delivery is very time consuming and on top of that they more or less forced us to take their stuffed crust which is of BDT 095. They have thin crush which they don't charge extra money for but that was not available. So it clearly proves that they are taking extra money for their so called stuffed crust forcefully! Now a days customers are willing to spend extra money on good food so you don't have to steal it from us showing lame excuses. If that is your business strategy then I suggest you to develop your business skills along with your pizza taste! They wrote BDT 600++ for their medium sized pizza but they took 990 instead because of stuffed crust which is so not worth the money!",0
Worst Sphaghetti I ever had in my life...n amount was not even enough for one person ï¿½ never going there(uttara branch) again -_-,0

Worst pizza ever... Don't go for any buy 0 and get 0 offer.. ï¿½,0

Very high price of every item. Pizza is very small in size compared to value,0
I went to pizza in with two of my foreigner friends cause they wanted to try good pizza. But in pizza inn Dhanmondi they served us pizza with very thick crust and very thin layer of cheese. Chicken pieces were superficially given on top of that. I felt so insulted in front of my guests. They left the place with an impression that Bangladesh doesn't have any good pizza place. Really disappointed,0
"With previous several times good experiences yesterday I went to police plaza concord brach at around 0:30 pm & wanted to place order their ""buy 0 medium pizza, get 0 free"" offer. But they denied to take order saying it will need more than 0 and a half hour (which will exceed the offer time), as they don't have dough of medium size. it is only the large size that I can order!! I never expected this kind of disgusting trick from such a reputed place!",0
Very very poor amount of ingredints in pizza mainly the amount of cheese.totally worthless.,0
"Ordered through their online home delivery system at 00:03 p.m. and received the food at 03:05 pm. but they said it would be delivered by 00:30 p.m. When I called at 00:30 p.m. to ask about the order they informed me that the ordered had not been placed due to a server error, although I had already talked to them before that and they informed nothing then. When we asked for a discount for the horrible service, they said they would give a discount but the delivery man asked for the whole bill. Pizza was ok but will not be ordering again...at least not online. If you cannot keep up your own servers then you should make deals with third-parties like hungrynaki.",0
Poor poor poor mayn. The taste was like ï¿½. And also with a big rate of price.,0
This the most hazardous childish disappointing packaging I've ever seen my life ... Seriously you need upgrade your packageing .. Otherwise this will turn into serious Complan & I'll be first one to report,0
"First of all if i start talking about the pizza, it was almost tasteless. I ordered one of their large pizzas, and due to a running offer i got one for free. If they cannot provide good quality pizza in an offer, why do they even give such offers! Again, totally disappointed with their slow service. The waiters are not even trained well. Whenever i wanted a tissue or a drinks, they started calling each other to serve me taking 5/00 mins just to come and talk. Never going back.",0
"Poor service. Average quality of pizza, at best they can manage. Unbelievably slow. Ordered three items and it took them one and half hour to serve it. Don't even place tissue on the table: went there with 3 people. And they place just four tissues under forks and knives. and that's it. You want more tissue, they'll listen and will be gone. Ultimately, you have to fetch them yourselves. Paid for about 4k Tk, all of which feels completely wasted on nothing.",0
"Mirpur Branch: Ill behaved waiters! Dont know the simple COURTESY to behave with customers. Whenever i complained it, the manager tried to cover it. LOL. Please take necesary trainings for all your staffs. Never recommend it. You can be one of those customers facing disrespect.",0
"Worst pizza ever tasted. Ordered pizza with sausage crust. They gave it wrong. When complained, they replied saying they got technical issues (which was a very lame excuse). They used local cheese instead of Mozzarella. Made a chaos during providing the bill too. Overall I would have given a negative 5 if there was an option. All I can say is, train your waiters first before starting an outlet.",0

"Whenever we crave for pizza 'pizza inn' just pop into our mind. But this time it went horribly wrong. After having their pizza my wife vomit 0 to 3 times. I was feeling sick too. Another thing to save the time for making pizza quick they just put cheese and toppings on their ready made crust. Then they put it in the oven . Done in 5mins may be less than that. I'm not lying . Still have couple of slices left in my fridge. Plz guys instead of bringing more branch , bring some quality. And for me adios 'Pizza inn'. From Uttara - a never coming back customer.",0

Worst experience ever... if you can't serve your own menu items then you should close the outlet of uttara.. and stuff was like please get out... just because gas problem in uttara they can't even serve frnchfries... also they can't make coldbeverage items.. funny.. btw cant explain the test of the pizza.. crust is like toast... so please if you can't maintain your standard then stop making foolish people.,0
Very bad pizza. Don't waste your money or time....,0
Bad Quality. Low amount of cheese which is not tasty.,0
"worst pizzas I have ever tasted!! no flavour no cheese!! crust is like ""paoruti"" and topping?? omg!! you put 0 pieces of chicken and a single piece of onion ring! thank you so much for your kindness! shittiest pizza in the world! disgusting! If I could I would rate it (-0000000000000000)",0
"I ordered 0 medium pizza , 0 garlic bread 0 mushroom for home. When I recieved it was packed. They said everything is ok. I came back home and 0 spicy mushroom was missing. Not acceptable at all. Not recommending mirpur outlet.",0
"I liked the ultra thin crusted pizzas...but it seems the chefs often forget to season the pizzas properly. We went yesterday to enjoy the BOGO offer at Gulshan branch, pizzas were good but we had to add seasoning to make the taste perfect, the pizzas were under seasoned. Please ask your Chefs to check the seasoning while they make the products or before serving, I do believe it will make your products more tastier. Service and environment were nice, though the server never came to follow up at all. It was my first visit, I would like to request you to train your servers on how to follow up with customers as well, it creates good impression about the brand, isn't it? Thanks",0
The ever worst restaurant i have seen in my hole life...worst service....everything is worst...,0
I went to the Banani outlet of Pizza Inn Bangladesh today.... Got disappointed after tasting the pizza :( . Expected more tasteful pizza ... According price it was not as good as I expected .,0

"Pizza quality degraded. Better quality pizza you will find in Taltola, Khilgaon Chowdhury etc places. Not value for money.",0
"dear pizza inn maintain the standard when you give such offer. if you cant afford it then please dont give such promotional offer.people came to enjoy pizaa not to waste money on bread and cheese -_-. went to pizza inn and ordered chicken bbq special pizza large and got a free large pizza as well. but the quality is too low. 80% of the pizza was bread,crust was hard like toast and cheese quality OMG it feels like rubber after 5 minutes. first and last visit to pizza inn. recommending people not to go during offer time. dont know about the quality in regular time.",0
Pizza inn shouldn't introduce such offer where they cant maintain the minimum standard. This has been my favourite pizza shop in town always even in such offer time. This time i heard so many bad comments from friends but with my previous experience I ignored to believe them and here i am today with utter disappointments. I believe even my maid can made better pizza than this. Most surprisingly the guy serving the pizza doesn't even know which flavor they are serving. I guess this is the last time i am visiting pizza inn.,0
"Pizza Inn had always been a top choice for me in terms of ordering pizza at home. They had always been very cooperative till today. I ordered from the Crazy offer for me and my friends and what I got to hear was they had only 0 delivery man and both of them were out. So they can't. With such minimum manpower, it's not possible to offer good service. If it's not possible for them to serve their customers in spite of having so much busy schedule, they should reconsider their home delivery service then.",0
"I went to your Uttara outlet to avail the ""FNF Offer"" today around 09:00PM. Before going there, i checked your website and decided to order One Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large & One Deep Dish Pizza Large. When I was ordering Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large, the waiter told me that there is no such Pizza of Pizza Inn named Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large. When I told him that I have checked your website, he replied it can't be there. After that when I told him about t...he Deep Dish Pizza, he replied it is not included in the Offer. He also told me ""Deep Dish Pizza is very EXPENSIVE. It will cost around TK.0800."" Now my questions are: 0. If there is no such Pizza of Pizza Inn named Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large, then why you are displaying in your website? 0. If I have checked your website, then I am certain about the prices of the Products. Do you tell your customers that ""Sir, this Pizza is expensive. Don't take this one? Later I ordered BBQ Chicken Classic Large & Meaty Max Pizza Large. This is not the first time I am getting this kind of customer service from your Uttara Branch. Several months back, I experienced this kind of unprofessional customer service. But I ignored that time, because I get better service in your Banani & Gulshan Branch. You simply can't run your business with this kind of unprofessional team. One will not surely pay for getting this kind of shitty service.",0
Stupidest service at your Uttara outlet. your staff doesn't have any clue of your online offers. They first said Pizzainn does not have any pizza called Roasted garlic chicken pizza. Then i ordered deep dish pizza - Hear this how idiotic a staff can be - Your staff told me deep dish pizza is costly. I told that moron cost is my call not his. then he said deep dish pizza is not part of offer. This is my last time at PIZZAIN. PATHETIC,0
"Came today for the first time here with loads of expectations. I had today one chicken tandoori pizza, one french fries, chicken drumsticks and one apple juice. The pizza was so oily and loaded with cheese and for that reason, i didn't like that. I couldn't find the exact taste of pizza because all i could find was the taste of cheese and cheese. So i didn't like the pizza at all. The french fries was good btw. But the drumsticks was so tasteless that i couldn't eat them all.... They were loaded with so much masalas that i couldn't find the actual taste of it also. I didn't like that one also. Lastly comes the apple juice. I couldn't understand whether it was apple juice or not. Because bad smell was coming from that juice. So i didn't have that one also. Not going to come here anymore. Waste of money!!!!! Another thing, the waiters which are serving don't know which food is available for the day. They have to ask their superior all the time. Isn't it annoying?",0
"I went there with high expectations but my god wish I knew what was waiting for me. The price was exceedingly high but food quality was rather poor, taste was cliched. I went there with few of my relatives & it was a total embarassment for me. Most horrible part was, all of us had food poisoning.",0
"Very Poor Service. Out of 00 slices I had yesterday,I could only have 3 flavors. And waited for more but they said it will take 05-00 mins more. Being pissed off I left",0
Poor sitting arrangement. They treat customers as beggers.,0
Worst Seating Arrangement in Unlimited Pizza Offer in this Ramadan.,0
900 taka per person is quiet expensive. Must deliver soup items.,0
Poorest service ever! Went there yesterday for iftar and their service was terrible taste and quality of pizza was disgusting! I always loved pizzas from pizza inn but after yesterday their awful service made me hating this place so much. Don't go there for unlimited pizza offer! Service 0/00 Taste 0/00,0
Worst place ever for having pizzas. The core reason is because of their poor service,0
"Pizza inn is my 0nd favorite place for pizzas. I always loved their pizza and behavior. But today I was very disappointed tasting their pizzas. I found it very dry and not up to the mark. I never thought they would decrease their level of taste and quality . I ordered their recent offer buy one medium pizza get one for free. But I was very disappointed tasting cause I took the same offer last week but that was up to the level but today alas, it's nowhere near the taste. ... I told the waitress that today's pizza don't taste well she remained silent without any apology or question. This is surely not the pizza inn it used to be.",0
"Too much poor service that's why went out from your restaurant without taking food. Today I went there with my friend and wait for 00 minutes but nobody gives us the menu than called for menu 3times, after getting the menu and take the decision about pizza we called several times for service so loudly and I person came and went away in the middle of my question. I called again and tell them to clean the table we want to sit and replied it will take time. All the service man gathering and chatting without giving service. This is my first experience with worst service and this is the first time I went out from a restaurant without testing food.",0

Went There Today At 4:00pm For The Buy One Get One Pizza.Asked Them If The Offer Is Still On They Looked At There Hand Watch (Offer Valid Till 5pm) And Said Yes Sir.I Was About To Make The Order And Suddenly He Said Sorry Sir We Can't Take Your Order Cause There's No Electricity. Huh Seriously? -_- Good Luck To You Guys ï¿½,0
"They still didn't manage sufficient electricity supply when there is power failure. Tried the set A, they couldn't even serve sub and chicken fry. Had to wait till the power came. The pizza was average and so was the pasta. Chicken fry and sub was quite good though. It's been around 4 months since they opened it and they still didn't fix the electricity issue, and still didn't start accepting card payment. About the AC, they don't turn on all the ACs all the time, so you may... sweat at times. Should work on these things, to satisfy the customers. Price is reasonable according to the FOOD QUALITY. Hope for the best.",0

Decorations are nice. Overall environment is like fish market. Peoples talk so loudly. Generally peoples come to restaurant not only for quality foods but also for having some quality time with family or friends.

Went there to avail an pasta offer! Found that the offer was totally wastage of tym n money .They r offering one small pasta free with large one.But the quantity is very poor.It seems lyk they just divided one pasta into two bowl.Cheese and meats were very little in amount and the so called large pasta is very expensive and small in quantity. Service is really poor.,0
"I tasted very poor quality food served by them yesterday. The food was so salty that I had to push them to change it. Though they changed it on my request but it was salty on 0nd attempt as well. Every time, they took 05-30 minutes to serve food. However, I had wonderful food experience at star lounge before but I don't think I am going there again. They have changed their chef which they admired on my query. Upon my complaints, the manager even didn't bother to apologise, rather she was irritated. Waste of money now a days!",0
"The horriblest pizza I have ever tasted! the service was shockingly bad!! Looks can deceive!! the environment looked good, but food was bad,hospitality was worst! Had to call 3 times for order,they were too busy.....the pizza was ""chicken lounge pizza""!

Service was very slow as i checked in there on previous week for ifter. I'm not also happy with food quality as i found very light-wattery Halim with tow piece of bone!!! It really shocking. Tea wasn't also good. It was not creamy at all. Only environment was good there. Hope it'll improve..,0
They served the order after 45 minutes. When we asked they told chicken just arrived. Peri Peri chicken was half cooked. Very expensive. Service very poor.,0
very bad service. They are unable to give buy 0 get one offer through VISA card due to their network problem. they are very much unprofessional.,0
They serve the food very slowly... One item served 30 min later of the 0st item that we ordered..,0

Had chicken pasta and cashew nut salad. Pasta was very bland. Not enough seasonings and lack of any kind of taste. Amount of meat or mushroom was tiny. White sauce they surved was weird and . Couldn't eat half of the pasta. Cashew nut salad was below average. Chicken in the salad was probably a few days old.,0

"The taste of the pizza was very bad. Although they say the cheese will be more in chicken Supreme pizza, There was no cheese in pizza. Very dirty places.",0
"0. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 0. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 079tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.",0
"Their behaviour was bad, i repeat their ""BEHAVIOUR"" was ""BAD"". We wanted some change as we gave all of our ""khuchra"" tk at the time of order. But they didn't even have the courtesy to say politely that they didn't have any change, it was like we were beggars asking them for money. We ordered both chicken and beef, the amount of chicken was really poor, it was really a fancy cheese version of typical local pizza. So don't get confused by the price.",0
I have waited more than one hour still the food was not ready!,0
"Their pizzas are just average. But behavior is quite extra ordinarily ""POOR"" we ordered 4 pizzas costing about 860. We paid them with 000 taka notes.

"Last night I along with my 03 colleagues went there for buffet dinner. The items like beef or mutton curry were not up to the mark, meat lovers like us may be disappointed. 00 items of soup, fried chicken and noodles were good. Surprisingly, we found no item of prawn. We felt salads and dessert items poor and limited. I found small hair in different dishes which disturbed me a lot but I did not say anything as my mates could lose their appetite. Ambience and behaviour were good. Overall response is that Tk 800++ price for that standard buffet dinner is quite much and they must improve to ensure hygiene.",0
Yesterday it was embarrassed for me. Significantly detoroiate the cooking quality. Hopefully this restaurant will shut down suddenly. The worst restaurant in Dhaka city. Try to avoid this restaurent. Huh!,0
Serviceman behave very bad to the customers.they underestimate their customers.food was average. But the food is not the fact.the fact is they directly argued with the customers.no policies.contains plenty of cheatings.their attitude and expression will mean you that they r teaching you and you r first time in restaurant.many worst policies they have which they wont mention you.most attentional sight was many worst policies you will see from them which you will never find anywhere.honestly I can say that if any one gathers here you won't came here for second time.and also reviews them 0.5 out of 5 ratings.im giving 0.0 ratings cz the food was average good that's why.but if I focus on behavior and policies I will rate it 0.5 out of 5.,0
"The worse buffet restaurant in Dhaka City. Totally waste of money. The price was too much (Tk :0k) for dinner buffet. On the other hand, quality and taste of the food ......totally rubbish. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0

The food was average. But I and my family having loose motions after having their buffet dinner. Very much disappointing. I wish i could give them 0 out of 5. The only perk would be their service. Service was good and prompt.,0
Very disappointed. Worst buffet I ever had.,0
"Very simple comments- I think food is ok. All over lack of business attitudes. â€¢Ice cream was finished before 00PM and they replied ""it finished"" what kind of chit attitude was that. It's a restaurant that, shouldn't think to second time visit.",0
Behaviour was not good. Lackings of food iteams in buffet. Taste was not up to the mark. Additional 00% service charge which is too high.,0
"Not so special, dessert items are very ordinary, food quality are ok. But items reduced than last visit. With compare to price its only fair in my opinion.",0
Totally waste of money. One of the worst buffet in the city.,0
"Poor ! Poor ! Poorest quality, in my experience. Not recommended!",0
"I am boring with the service,i wanted soft drink twice but denied, it was horrible experience",0
Worst experience. Their service and behaviour to the customers is disgusting. It has disappointed me much.,0
Waiters are not well manared....they are like #Shit,0

The ambience is good but we had issues with the food as the shrimp dish was stale and after complaining they compensated with a delicious lamb dish which was specially cooked for the members of the Bangladesh Cricket Board members.,0
"thursday i visited khilgaon branch with my friends for iftar. With a great expectation we ordered two SET FOR 0 items, but after seeing the platter we were at a loss that ; as the platter including that pizza and pasta was totally a joke!!!!!!!!!!!! at first pizza was 6 inches , and we cant choose any flavor, secondly we were not allowed to choose pasta too. and lastly when we started eating the pasta was nothing but only boiled pasta with no flavor at all. And all this cos... a total horrible experience and we never expected that. At least you should had maintained your pizza and pasta quality. A totally overpriced platter. i am a regular customer of alfresco dhanmondi branch , but i must say khilgaon branch must be the worst.",0
I ordered pizza italiano via foodpanda. The crust was very undercooked. The edges got burnt yet which doesn't make sense. The toppings were not sufficient.,0
#Pasta_Al_Fresco clearly it's going to make this place down... if this is the title dish then you should just go to hell dear cause this was not pasta actually it was some mayonese and tomato sauce dipped macaroni in lots of oil... where we didn't find any shrimp... very less mashroom... not as mentioned in the menu..and instead of cheese they probably gave flour coating :v only view cannot make your ratings up... have you ever had a good pasta? then you should know...that ...,0

Too pricey and overrated. They added a thin slice of lemon in a glass of coke and the price was 05 tk. Also the taste of the menus were below average,0
We tried the set menu. The taste was very bad. Recommend not to try the set menu.,0
I'm still wondering what could possibly be the reason behind their pricing strategy ! Its extremely overpriced compared to their taste and quantity. Expected better !,0
Bad customer service,0
Um sry. Food wasn't good. Chicken was bad. Rice was lil smelly. Overall it was a bad experience..,0
Worst food at good price. Waste of valuable time with money. Total loss.,0
"quality is not good like before, extra service charge is not fair",0
Worst pasta ! But pizza is fine compared to pasta that's why it deserves 0stars .,0
They really need to improve their service Very poor service.,0

The Pasta Al Fresco was horrendous. The cheese layer was untearable and the whole thing has left a very bad taste in my mouth.,0
wrost food I have ever tested recently. Only coke was consuable.,0

"Worst pizzas Iâ€™ve ever had in my life ! I mean seriously, u guys called them pizza? & those whoâ€™ve given 5 star ratings, have u guys ever tried pizza hut, dominos or atleast pizza inn ? Donâ€™t confuse others by giving fake ratings, dats totally wastage of money. & Le pizzaria Stop posting totally thousands time different pictures of pizzas while promoting ur page!",0
"Worst pizza place ever, the guy who speaks on the phone to take orders cannot be more disrespectful and arrogant. They promise one thing and deliver something unexpected. And on the top they put the blame on customers for their mistakes.",0
Alas! There is no 0 star! Worst behaviour! A lots of mosquitos! And pizza is not that good. ðŸ˜ ,0
"Interior was good but it was full of mosquitoes.It's better to chew peanuts in zoo than having pizza here.The softdrinks they served was pale,may be water was mixed with it.And last but not the least rather most important thing that this place introduced us with a whole new definition of chocolate lava cake! they served doraemon cake (which anyone can find in any grocery shop,00/- each) with chocolate syrup on it & named it chocolate lava cake....ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0
"Bad experience!! Their medium pizza which they say is 8 inch, but when served it was 6 inch. Also the pizza was tasteless and it had little amount of cheese!! Never going back!!",0
"in just 0 word..... it has worst taste,I have ever experiencedd.....",0
"Ordered food and made payment like more than hour ago and just now they are delivering. Totally unacceptable. I had to call them more than 5 times, sent a boy to pick up later. A service which is unforgettable!!!",0
"Worst pizzas! They doesnâ€™t even taste like pizzas ! Donâ€™t go there & waste ur money, because itâ€™ll definitely result into making u regrets ! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0
Worst pizza !! ... Too less cheese without any taste.. Forget this place if you want a better Pizza.,0
Worst service in town...taste horrible... Pizza is not enough spicy and cheesy,0
Pizza is fine but i ve the problem with the size according to the price its nt worthy,0
"Dhanmondi branch: Poor service. Home delivery depends on there mode. Today's I called them to delivery but their feedback was "" lok nai sir, raining bla bla"" ( no rain ï¿½ though)",0

"Totally disappointed with the taste. Probably it's because of the offer, but it tasted horrible",0
"I hate to give negative review, but your pizza is disgusting. Garlic Mushroom was good though.",0
They've a good ambience I must say. The service was fast and quick. The waiters were good at there job. But I didn't like the taste of their pizza and if you're not good at what you're offering then service and ambience won't do any good. There were sufficient amount of cheese but which tasted super crapy and I find the amount of onions were much more than the actual topping. I ordered the Family Size Double Trouble and Buffalo Wings. The wings tasted decent enough. So If before you visit this place give it a thought coz there are far better options. And Yeah The Pricing was okay for me not expensive at all and obviously affordable. Thanks,0
Service quality was too much bad & pizza taste was medium not so good,0
"Got 0 pizzas an hour back through foodpanda. I must say I'm very disappointed with the amount of toppings you guys have given. The small squared slices of pepperoni was insignificant in the family sized pizza in comparison with the 900+tk you guys charge for one! But the amount of cheese surely covered the empty areas; no doubt about that! I'm sorry to say, but I'm never ordering pizzas from you guys.",0
"I ordered a 4kg rainbow cake for my Office Promotional celebration and I got seriously ashamed because of your cake which tasted really bad.. The food color was too much, the cream didnt blend well...over all it was really disgusting. I spent 7000/- just to buy some criticism towards me... i will never ever buy anything from you.",0
"Yesterday, at the Gulshan 0 branch (opposite to DESCO office) of Coopers, I found the bakery section infested with insects. Instead of removing the contaminated food, the staff was busy in removing the insects after I showed that to him. It was a very disappointing experience. Please take prompt action.",0
"Went there a week back for Iftar, very limited items were served (was quite surprised to see) and they were not refilling properly, some items were served after around one hour of Iftar. Dessert section was most shocking, I found nothing to take on my plate! It was anything but a five star standard where as they charged us the highest for Iftar in Dhaka!",0
They didnâ€™t mentioned any card serial numbers on their online promotions of BOGO OFFER.... asking for visa platinum debit cart they told that yes itâ€™s available on it.. but after having lunch they said they have few serial numbers of cards only which can avail this offer.... this is totally harassing for a visitor who visited there after watching their promotions offer....,0
"Such a Waste of Money in their Iftar and Dinner Buffet , Food was cold late refile , no good taste of anything . Bad People Management as well it was like fish market .",0
Worst service ever! We bought 0 coupons for the â€˜boishakhi food fairâ€™ on pohela boishakh and when we reach the restaurant (06th floor) they kept telling to wait because they were gonna shift it to lobby. We complained and they reluctantly served us food some food and kept us waiting for our remaining food while not even giving us any importance that we kept waiting (even though the food was ready). We got so annoyed we left without even eating. Waste of 0000tk coupon. Worst service and unwelcoming looks from the waiters as we waited for the food. NEVER going back,0
Very bad service. Food quality was extremely bad. They provided wrong information regarding buy 00 get 00 offer so we had to expense more.,0

I overall don't like this hotel.... Only photography is real.... Nothing else ...,0
"They are charging almost 4,000 (3,999) BDT for the buffet but do not bother to make arrangement to keep the food warm. Cold food ruined the taste of the items. My brother went there with his guest yesterday & became embarrassed of the food situation. if you don't want to keep your kebabs hot, then don't charge that much cz other buffets are charging less but giving better service than you. Pissed Off",0
Good menu but mediocre taste. Nothing exciting to the palate. The fruit table was good as was the nehari. Other items were ... Just there.,0
Below average standard .. Communication with clients is bad nd behaviour should be developed ..,0
"Clearly a waste of time and money . The dishes were way below average . Nothing resembled the advertisement. Pure Deshi cuisine plus a few salads and desserts is not worth 0000 taka. Last but not least , the restroom was dirty and stall was too small for a hotel. ... Pizza Hut has a bigger washroom than yours . Definitely not coming back here anymore . Shall never recommend anyone to come here either .",0
This was worse experience of being there at eatery restaurant. In the street food market fest there were no Chinese dim sum station. There was sushi but very limited. Bottom line is they show something and in reality they serve something else. This is one way of cheating people. Food quality is very low.,0
0 elevators to go up to the restaurant?you keep waiting for the lift to go up & come down?? forget it man .. we have other choices in gulshan..,0
"Most of the items were below average. Though there are many dishes, most of them don't deserve more than a bite. The advertisement is not all revealing, though it mentions Buy 0 Get 0 on Stan Chart Cards, there are particular specifications of the cards with offer, not all Standard Chartered Cards are liable to get the offer. And most importantly, though the advertisement mentions the Buffet price to be 3540 ( all inclusive), what has not been mentioned is that this excludes all beverages including water which will be charged at an exhorbitant rate plus 06.5% extra VAT and service charge on that. So those who are planning to go to the Street Food Festival, think twice.",0
The food was horrible compared to la meridian while taking price in account. The restaurant eatery was small and had a handful to offer. I called them up to enquire about the maki rolls before going and found premade small rolls that was tasteless and looked cheep. Their continental side had few things to offer aswell. All in all dnt waste your money and time.,0
the one star is for the ambience and the lamb chops in the buffet. all the other items were pretty bad and they sucked. really SUCKED! To be honest its not worth tk.3500 that they are charging per person. who the hell gives papaya and tomato inside a crepe? its really sad when hotels like this provide food like baton rouge! money wasted. please hire some good chefs,0
Very bad service... That's all I can say... And heavily charged.,0
"Expanding business from Gulshan and Banani to Dhanmondi was a bad move for Pizza Roma basically cause it meant their quality being degraded. A stale pizza diavola with a hard crust and chewy dough was delivered with no sauces or chili flakes, especially when extra sauces was an added request. More than annoying, bad pizzas are just disappointing specifically considering Pizza Roma is the pizzeria we've all come to love.",0
"I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Absolutely horrible. It was dry, bland and tasted microwaved. After coming home i got sick. My partner ordered a beef panini which was Okay at best. Neither justified their price.",0

"There are some newspapers in our Bangladesh and their main job is create propaganda. Bangladesh Pratidin is one of them. Also as it's part of Bashundhara it's another objective is to protect its heinous deeds. They don't bother to apologize, always spread out false, defamatory news. Another disturbing fact is they have now news channel which is also propaganda house. Main objective here is to propagation of Bashundhara. A cheap editor runs the newspaper, we shouldn't expect any good from them.",0

"The menu is tempting. Prices seems reasonable. Food quality? I doubt! Every dishes I ordered today, but the garlic naan, was way too salty. I guess it was quite flavourful but that salt just couldn't let me enjoy the food. Top of it when I complaint the issues by saying, ""your food was great but too much salty"", it seemed like it wasn't much of an issue for the staffs. They didn't even bother saying a sorry!",0
"I dnt knw abt the quality of food. Waited a long time but no one served the menu until we asked for it. Then we started waiting again, bt no one bother to take order. Finally we got out of the restaurant & again no one bothered.",0

They should learn how to do grill.they just fry the chicken and sell it as grill chicken..I don't want to come back to this place ever again,0

Nothing is good about this restaurant..ðŸ˜  bad food worse service and there has not been any smoking zone Chela maye open e Bose smoking krce..I think parents nea emn environment e jaur kono way naiðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡and their service person were more bg their actual work.. price is very much high but service is not good food test below average..so I'm not their satisfied customer.,0
"Place and decoration is good but they have to be more professional in terms of behavior with customers. We booked the place for 4-8 pm but ask for floor charge after the party that they didnt mentioned before. Behavior of the owner was like ""Gulisthaner Rickshawala"" seems we occupied the place for free. The food quality was worst as well. They remind me the old proverb "" à¦šà¦• à¦šà¦• à¦•à¦°à¦²à§‡à¦‡ à¦¸à§‹à¦¨à¦¾ à¦¹à§Ÿà¦¨à¦¾ """,0
ill behaviour..May be the manager came from uneducated background or donâ€™t know how to behave with customers...Open/Roof top area actually smoking area..I was not able to have a seat there bcz a group of ppl were smoking....And they donâ€™t bother...Food quality nothing special...,0
If there was an option for 0 star i would have chosen that because this restaurant doesnâ€™t even deserve any STAR!Worst food along with the WORST service! Their food tasted like a shit!Literally tasteless food which took more than 40 minutes to arrive!The price of their food was over priced which didnâ€™t meet the required taste!Not even close!!! **The most worst part of this restaurant is their service!I would rate it -0 The waiters were too much rude! They behaved very rudely!...,0
yesterday I went there.. place looks good. but their behavior and food were terrible .They are very irresponsible and staffs are mannerless..,0
Over priced .. tasteless food .. ill behaviour and I'm not going there again and recommend you to not go there .,0
They r not professional..Food and service was too poor..Service was bull shit..,0
They are flying just because of some paid reviews. Test of food and quality is very poor.,0
Worst service ever...!! Yeah nice place to hangout and to take pictures but the behavior of the waitors are so unacceptable....even the food was not up to the mark !!,0
Food is to much bad....,0

Nice ambience with very poor quality of food. I tried very poor street food to 5stars in dhaka. But #JustThai have the worst wonthon i ever tried.,0
Only thing good about this place is the environment and sitting area. Das it. You get the 0 stars for that. Food is plain and bland. Hope to see improvements to your services.,0

Worst home delivery service ever seriously!!!!!!! Worst ever!!!,0
Taste is as usual. Nothing different. Need to improve the quality.,0
The food was good enough. biriyanis tasted quite near delicious. taste - 9/00 But service!!!!! OMFG!!!!! I have never felt so miserable. went there with some of my friends and a elder brother. They treated us like SHIT. let me give you an example. we had to wait for 00 minutes for a bowl of daal only. they kept forgetting the orders. 0st of all they gave us only 3 glasses. But we were 7/8 sitting in the table. when we asked for more glass they gave us dirty glasses and that also after waiting for 5 minutes. And when we asked for the manager they didn't even pay any attention. Even though we were sitting just before the cash counter. If you want to have tasty biriyani and want to feel helpless. you are most welcome.,0
Beef akhni was horrible ... totally waste of money :(,0
"I took afgani chicken biriani,the taste was average chicken was just like boiled chicken without any spices.I couldn't eat so I took parcel and then when I open it at home there was no chicken they didn't gave me the chicken.Bad experience totally.",0
"Served me regular 50 tk worth beef tehari as akhni biriani for 060 tk,when I complained about it they told me it is indian akhni!! blah blah blah,they have no idea about what chittagongian akhni biriyani is.I bet their mezbani items are fake regular beef items too.Now I feel scammed,So if you want to taste traditional chittagongian beef menus never ever think about it,it is only ok for having your regular meal.",0
"Really we enjoyed very much. Foods are very testy tough some hot, but overall nice especially complementery item coconut ice cream .",0

Overrated. Egg hopper was too salty.service was okay.,0
Way too overpriced with a very typical food type. The portion size is ridiculous. With some other foods we took an egg hopper which costs 097+00% SC +05%VAT plus and its exactly à¦¡à¦¿à¦® à¦šà¦¿à¦¤à¦‡ which we can get at 05 taka. We had to made ourselves satisfies by dining in at Time out just near Taste of Lanka to satisfy our tummy. The owner claimed they have to import everything from Srilanka (why a guy need to have eggs and beef from Srilanka I did not get it though) which sounded like comedy of Russel Peter to me........and I literally laughed out.....,0
Worst fried rice I ever eat. I visited to BFC on Eid day and ordered combo meal. I found it was worst fried rice i have ever eat. I shall never visit Mirpur BFC and will not encourage anyone to waste money.,0
I'm their regular customer..but last day I took my parcel for iftar & alas!! chicken fry was smell so bad couldn't even have this in a bite Shame of u bfc..how can u serve wrong expired food during ramadan!!??,0
The worst service that anyone can think about. If i could i would rate it in negative. Specially your Jashim uddin avenue one.,0
Worst customer service and behavior of employees. This place will cheat you. Dont reccomend at all.,0

"Caution: Experience sharing for better serving. I have been with BFC's food since 0004.for me BFC chicken is the best in the town.I have visited almost all the branches in Dhaka and know many outlet managers those who are working for the last 00 years.But it is really sad to say, BFC, Mirpur 00 branch has got some problems. I have been there several times since I have shifted my residence in Mirpur. The staffs are not well mannered. I have shared some of them, incident 0: one... day they have served me wrong drinks, when i objected the waiter said, it is not possible. incident 0: sometime a portion of the total area is blocked, i requested manager, he ignored. last incident: When a half of the sweet corn are eaten i have found some parts of a steel dish washing net inside, I complained they wanted to give another but i said no.The young outlet Manager was in front of me turned around even saying sorry.I was horrified about thinking their cleaning stuff.Hope authority will frequent visit their outlets and will check hygienic food ,cooking stuff and customers feedback's.DROPBOX is the better idea.and managers should be well trained., so that other staffs can perform better.",0
I have way too many tales of bad experiences with this low graded place. Can't hate it enough. They need to be removed from this planet. CHEATS.,0
"If you ever take a parcel from BFC, never leave without checking your food. I ordered breasts and I came home to find thighs, and this happened twice, in two seperate occasions. They overcharged me for something i DID NOT order. This is unacceptable, and I expected better from the Uttara branch.",0

Most importantly their #meyo tasted weird as it had some kind of fish oil in it ...,0

The worst food i ever ate so far. It was a total waste of time and money.,0
First of all their welcome drink not refreshing at all it was tangy spicy ! Cashewnut salad was way too spicy and just killed the tastebud!And I ordered cheesy fries and they gave me fries over fried on top ketchup and little amount of melted cheese and the worst part was when I asked this isn't cheesy fries they took it and came after 5 minutes saying this is how we make it? They didn't even bothered to change it rather put the same shit on my table so I just simply said it's alright take it away can't eat it ! They are basically popular for the platter but other menu aren't up to the mark.,0
You can eat here but nothing to enjoy. Poor Service. we ordered GOLD platter which came on time but the food was cold. But we were really hungry so we jumped in. we got only one chicken piece so we asked the waiter to cut into two pieces. and then everything went wrong. the waiter went with the chicken and then it never came back. after 05 mins when we aksed for the chicken the waiter looked surprise and said checking sir. and then he came back after five minutes. but to our surprise the chicken went to another table. and then when we asked again the waiter took those chicken for the that customers table and brought to us. at this moment i lost my temper and i asked,0
I..........Love.........this.......place.....ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,0
Food quality is not up to the mark comparing to the price.,0
"Took the gold platter....Prawn wasn't worth eating!!! 0 types of rice given...One was white, other was yellow!!! ï¿½ But both were shitty and tasted the same.... The quantity of food doesn't worth 500/= but my great pocket was an 800/= donor... ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0

"My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 0 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R0, & it seemed to me that I paid 0500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.",0
I went to MFM on Saturday around 4:00 pm along with my Family. I ordered 4 dori special and Onion Rings and Mussels. Onion Ring was really bad and dori salad was stale and smell bad. Mussels were ok. We ordered four drinks but even after our meal is completed we did not get the drinks. My kids ordered two Gummy Bear flavour and they did get that either. Kids were extremely disappointed ï¿½,0
"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 05 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 05 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 05 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN",0
This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.,0
Cause apparently using the washroom for more than 00mins means you are a yabakhor,0
Worst seafood I have ever insulted my mouth with..... cooking skill is disastrous....!!!,0
I was wrongfully harassed and physically assaulted by the employees today.,0
Honestly Very disappointed. Overpriced. We ordered 5 items but dissatisfied. Very Small amount of food if I compare with money.Ya fish portion was tasty but half cup rice and rice was not properly boiled in one item. Waste of money on those diet food.,0
Tried their creamy mushroom pasta and dory fish and to be honest I am really disappointed with the taste because I went there before and it was quiet good.,0
they harass the customers.,0
Abusive to customers,0
Really shitty food. Steer clear. By imported Fish from some supermarket or such and cook it yourself; it will be better than this.,0
Not up to the mark. Refreshroom was not clean. Food quality has detoroited a lot.,0
Very bad teste .. and price not satisfied with good amount .. fish and co is best,0
.... it was my first time but i actually didn't expect the taste to be like this .... the platter was not enough ... and the presentation was absurd as if like it doesn't mark up ... it doesn't make people feel the food ... the presentation is something you guys should work on and study on ... skills of cooking need to be level up ... skill development is needed ... still you have room to level up ... good luck .........,0
I was so dissatisfied about the taste..i took a sharing platter which was just a waste of money n time I felt.,0
Food was okay. Price is extremely expensive with extremely low quantity. I DON'T RECOMMEND.,0
Bland oily food with AC not working. Not my thing...,0
"I used to be a fan of this place but now im disappointed as hell. Today went there, ordered the CALAMARI MUSSELS CHICKEN. The first thing i noticed: NO broccoli, the chicken pieces were super thin, the Alabama shake we ordered had more foam than the shake itself, even the rice was less in quantity. All in all, highly disappointing experience. When we informed the management about the mishap, they were sprouting ridiculous BS as if we customers are dumb af. Honestly, the proportions are really less than what you are actually paying for. You lost a regular customer.",0
"Didn't like their iftar platter called ""Mussel Island""",0
Fish fillet has no taste and flavour.. salads are bitter in taste..total wastage of money,0
"Terrible experience today! Soup was cold, on our request they took them to reheat and this time it was even colder! Terribly disappointed. Not going there again, and definitely not recommended. #NotGoingThereAgain",0
The Drinks were not good.Food was not up to the mark. Fish & Co is better than this.,0
Worst ever see food experience. I took their grilled platter priced tk 0000. Amount of food was totally unacceptable compared to the price and taste was bogus as well.,0
Quality way down . :(,0
The food was horrible & disaster!! I never ever recommend to anyone to go there.,0
Food quality is poor.. :( & price is too high.. :\,0

Food was not so good. Service was quite slow. Giving 0 stars because the staff was very nice.,0
Quality doesn't go with prices,0
Food was good. But their service disappointed me. We were screaming for excusing us but nobody gave a damn about it. They took more than 0 hour to serve.,0
"For the first time, I have ordered two pizzas for home delivery. When they arrived, there was a terrible smell from the chicken one (Mexican Hot). Maybe it was their misplaced extra topping that made it worse as I ordered for extra cheese and not a buck-load of mushrooms. The beef one (Beef Bolognese) had no pepperoni on it. Moreover, the cheese they put felt dry & dusty and the dough felt real hard to swallow. Subpar ingredients, false advertisements ??........ maybe, maybe ... Lesson well learnt. Ramadan is definitely not an apt time to order comfort food. I consider myself simply, unlucky in this gamble.",0
Their service is poor. Waiter doesn't know which pasta is which. When we ordered a pasta first we found a hair on it and he hesitated to change it although we got a new one later.,0
worst service I've ever seen and top of that food wasn't good too. pure waste of time and money,0
"ï¿½ Worst experience of a lifetime in Dhanmondi! Iftar platers are costly! They serve the worst pasta ever! In short, Iâ€™m done with you guys & never returning again!",0
Bullshit service. Absolutely hated it. They kept me waiting for more than half an hour for just one burger. They don't even talk to the customers properly and mostly they don't have any responsibility. They don't even care . Worst resturant ever.,0
"Bullshit service, food took 40 minutes to be served, waiters ill mannered and importantly the food was absolutely disgusting",0
If there was something below 0 star would've given that waited for more than hour but food was never served. we ordered the pasta but their oven apparently broke down however it was fine for preparing pizza for other customers . Worst service ever. REPEAT NEVER GO THERE,0
"We ordered Pizza and burger , no complaint with foods , but waiters' behaviour was too much unprofessional that it makes me to rate them 0 . They took 0 hr to surve two Pizzas instead of 05 mins and they couldn't even surve sauce within time...",0

"Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy. I used to order from them a lot via Hungrynaki but the last time made me too disappointed with the quality of their dishes & have decided not to order from them anymore since you get only fried besan & flour.",0

Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .,0
"Whatâ€™s up with your cost saving techniques? Ac out fans running, one man doing cash, preparation and serving. If you claim to be an international chain but serve like a local street shop.

Ordered the kebab and was really surprised by the quantity of beef and other ingredients. i had to eat half the oily bread and then got the taste of the kebab. This is unacceptable from a food chain of this calibre. Serve your food the way it shows on the menu and dont deceive your customers.,0

"went for a get together with friends during iftar in the uttara outlet. the ramadan menu of 3 chicken wings, rice and coke was very disappointing. the portion was very small. rice was less and did not had any good taste so i needed to use ''ketchup'', which i normally dont do. the wings were not ''three'' pieces. it was just one wing piece cut into three pieces. i only liked the drink... staff were good and polite, service was good, but needs more improvement in taste and please dont fool people by mentioning ''three'' pieces of chicken wings....",0
Their quality of burger and sub and kabab rice is getting horriable day by day. Their branch In basundhara city's food quality is below poor rating.,0

Nothing special. Went to the Gulshan-0 branch. Had to ask several times for the mayonnaise and ketchup.,0
Extremely slow service. Made us wait 30 mins for one item( kebab rice). The taste was also below expectation. Extremely bland.,0
Thank you baba rafi. I used to love beef burgers a lot. I gained weight and I was worried! After I had your burger I felt like beef is the worst thing can happen inside a bun! Wat a disgraceful taste I must say! Baba...plz kill rafi and stop your business.,0

I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE BY THE MANAGER BECAUSE I COMPLAINED OF WAITING OVER 00 MINS TO PLACE AN ORDER WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME! Yeah that person has a right to place the order but my problem is BRafi didn't bring anyone up to help take orders. Apparently baba rafi doesn't care about your time.

You smell the 'ghee' from the far distance and keep wondering the food/ kabob must be good here! Sorry to break the news fellas. It's all about the dirty marketing strategies. They spread layers of ghee near the exhaust pipe and beautiful aroma is all around the restaurant. But the first bite of kabob is just enough to determine how horrible and low quality food they serve. Sure the food is cheap but taste matters! Avoid this restaurant altogether!!,0

I ordered food using Pathao app. The restaurant calls me and say that price have changed and I have to pay about 050 taka more per items that I ordered. According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant. The only thing that was good was the mashed potato tasted good.,0

food ta improve kora uchit+some new item add kora dorkar & food price ta aktu less kora uchit....,0
The taste of pasta wasn't good.................-_-,0
Food is okk. But service onk khrp. I was feeling like I was in moholla's local hotel. Music khub besi high bit lagse coz akta room ar moodhe airokom high bit song valo lage na. Akta table a 0 ta family bosha khub e awkward akta feeling. Aita hotel hole mana jeto bt it's a music cafe so I think environment ta oirokom vhabei maintain kora uchit. At end I can say that it's a very disappointed place.,0
price is so high..................................,0
tummy doesn't fill up by music...quality & quantity of food doesn't match the price,0
"This place was a bad experience. The food was bad, the cold drinks tasted like it had water in them and the bottles were dirty, there was no electricity the whole time we were there. The electricity thing might have not been totally their fault but if they are running a restaurant business then they need to make arrangement for electricity generators for this kind of situation. U canâ€™t just have one fan. It was suffocating. Horrible place............",0
keep it up (y),0
Not good at allzz. The services and unsafety parking facilities.,0
poor food quality with way too high price. service is average,0
Found hair in 0 of the food items and they replased both of it and gave 00% discount. But after coming home im feeling super sick and vomiting continuously. And my friends are feeling sick too Please be clean guys,0
"Worst service ever. Been waiting for an hour after ordering food. Apparently, they ran out of beef so someone went to buy beef from the supermarket.",0
Credit card machine doesnâ€™t work! I donâ€™t know how these guys think we will always carry cash! I will never come back.,0
Their FOOD quantity is very low & Roasted Duck dish is a joke. Served very tiny portion. Which is very unfair compare to the pricing we have paid. NOT Recommended.,0
Food was not good.. Compare to quantity price is high.. Will never go again..,0
"0. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 0. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.",0
food was 00/00 but quantity was too low that I couldn't even expect as per the price...,0
"Their AC is old, second hand, dont work properly and last day water was coming from the AC..i have changed my seat several times due to the hot temp...their service aint that bad but they should take care their customerâ€™s comfort. Their Sea food Soup is very good. I would love to visit again if they fix their AC asap....",0
The rice they served was cool. Taste very bad price too high compared to quantity they serve,0
Firstly their ac didn't work just useless and secondly the behavior of their waiter is very disappointing with little kids they Scrolled my daughter several she was just playing in the restaurant and only our table was full and no other customer was there in that time they can't handle a little kid it's so disappointing and good quality was so so I will not complain abt the food Cz it can be improve but their attitude and behavior will never improve so I will think twice to visit there aging,0
